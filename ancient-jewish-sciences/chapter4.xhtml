<blockquote>The science of <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier225" href="#index_entry_apocalypticism"/><a class="ff" href="#ier230"/>apocalypticism can be defined as the exact numerical calculation of the end of time. It is intended to provide absolute assurance to faith and hope. The science of apocalypticism, which numerically calculates the <i>when </i>of the End Time, rests on the belief that “everything must fulfill its course out of inner necessity.” It is the task of the seer to reveal this necessity. —Jacob Taubes<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-2" href="#endnote-chapter4-2">2</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>The earliest known Jewish scientific work is, probably not coincidentally, also the first known scientific work in <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier226" href="#index_entry_aramaic_at_qumran"/>Aramaic. This is the <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier227" href="#index_entry_enoch_books_astronomcal"/><a class="ff" href="#ier234"/><i>Astronomical Book</i> of Enoch, found at Qumran, the oldest manuscripts of which date to the 3rd century BCE The text is written in the cosmopolitan, high-cultural register of the <i>lingua franca</i> of the Babylonian and Persian empires known as Standard Literary Aramaic.<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-3" href="#endnote-chapter4-3">3</a></sup> Its contents consist of a series of rules for the movement of the heavenly bodies and the increase and decrease of hours of light over the course of the year, presented as visions seen by the antediluvian <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier228" href="#index_entry_enoch_cult_hero"/>patriarch Enoch during a tour of the universe conducted by the angel Uriel.</p>

<p>But why is the oldest known Aramaic science presented to a Jewish patriarch during a heavenly journey? <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier229" href="#index_entry_astrology_babylonian"/>Babylonian mathematics and astronomy are generally considered by historians of science to be the most highly developed empirical knowledge in the ancient world. This paper attempts to shed some light on the peculiar way that this most exact of sciences was presented in the Levant: as a set of mystical visions in an incipient Jewish <a class="index_entry_reference_no_print" id="ier230" href="#index_entry_apocalypticism"/>apocalyptic literature.<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-4" href="#endnote-chapter4-4">4</a></sup></p>

<p>The paper will approach this broad problem narrowly: by placing the <a class="index_entry_reference_no_print" id="ier231" href="#index_entry_enoch_books_astronomcal"/><i>Astronomical Book</i> in the cultural context of Hellenistic Judea and asking what one of the text’s key linguistic patterns—one heretofore little-recognized—tells us about this context. I take as an axiom that the role of social theory in philology is to frame interesting questions that the data are suited to answer. In this case, to understand what type of knowledge the <i>Astronomical Book</i> contains, <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier232" href="#index_entry_demarcation"/>it may not be as useful to ask “is it science for us?” as it would be to ask, “was it science for them?” and “if so, how?”</p>

<p>These questions set my agenda: to avoid anachronism and place the <i>Astronomical Book</i> in the history of science, we need to ask what systematic knowledge of the physical world might have meant to Hellenistic Jewish writers. The inherited genres of exact knowledge that are both well preserved to us and likely to have been important to scholars in Hellenistic Judea are contained in the <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier233" href="#index_entry_priests_priestly_literature"/>Priestly literature of the Pentateuch, so the first half of the paper will examine how these texts organize knowledge of the physical world. In the second half I will examine an Aramaic phrase that introduces formulae for calculating the hours of light in <a class="index_entry_reference_no_print" id="ier234" href="#index_entry_enoch_books_astronomcal"/><i>Astronomical Enoch</i>, as well as cosmic geography in the <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier235" href="#index_entry_enoch_books_watchers"/>Enochic <i>Book of Watchers</i>. Although it has not been remarked before, this phrase shows striking signs of being calqued on the Hebrew phrase that introduces plans for the <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier236" href="#index_entry_tabernacle"/>tabernacle in Exodus. If so, the language of knowledge in Enochic literature is closely based on the language of knowledge in Priestly literature.</p>

<p>This <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier237" href="#index_entry_hebrew_language"/>linguistic and literary pattern can cast some new light on how “science” was framed by early Jewish scholars. <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier238" href="#index_entry_aramaic_in_babylonia"/>Like its Babylonian ancestor, Enochic astronomy claims to be based on the <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier239" href="#index_entry_observation"/>observation and calculation of originally divine phenomena. But for Enoch, these <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier240" href="#index_entry_astronmy_babylonian"/>Babylonian calculations are presented through a story in which the data as well as their analysis are <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier241" href="#index_entry_revealed_knowledge"/>divinely revealed. The revelation of astronomy and cosmic <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier242" href="#index_entry_geography"/>geography to <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier243" href="#index_entry_enoch_vs_moses"/>Enoch is based on the revelation of the tabernacle to Moses in Exodus. Just as Moses is “caused to see” the proportions of the temple, Enoch is “caused to see” the calculations that specify the movements of the spheres. By emphasizing Enoch’s passivity in the observation and calculation of heavenly phenomena, these texts frame what we would consider empirical knowledge of the physical world in a very different kind of epistemology: a “revealed science” that helps explain how astronomy could function as part of an apocalypse.</p>

<h3>1. Did They Believe in Science? Ancient Jewish Knowledge about the Physical World</h3>

<p><a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier244" href="#index_entry_language_of_knowledge"/>Biblical texts show no interest in mathematics, astronomy, or what we would call science. Indeed, Deuteronomy 4:19 contains an explicit and pointed warning <i>against </i>the dangers of visual evidence of the physical universe. <a class="index_entry_reference_no_print" id="ier245" href="#index_entry_observation"/>Observation of the heavenly bodies is a temptation towards, perhaps because it provides evidence of, other gods—and therefore forbidden to Israel.<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-5" href="#endnote-chapter4-5">5</a></sup></p>

<p>But already before the completion of the Hebrew Bible, some Jewish writers were adopting very different attitudes toward knowledge of the physical world. Even as books like <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier246" href="#index_entry_daniel"/>Daniel were being completed, narrating the uselessness of <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier247" href="#index_entry_alien_wisdom"/>foreign knowledge in comparison to the revelations of Israel’s God (e.g. Dan 1:20, 2:19), Jewish writers had begun incorporating Babylonian mathematics and astronomy into major literary works.<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-6" href="#endnote-chapter4-6">6</a></sup> By the third century BCE, Biblical patriarchs like Levi and Enoch were represented as learning and teaching about numbers and the stars. And rather than crude improvisations, these teachings derived from the highly developed techniques of Babylonian scholarship, arguably the world’s first truly empirical scientific tradition.<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-7" href="#endnote-chapter4-7">7</a></sup> By the first century BCE, these new interests had been energetically and creatively integrated into the ritual framework of the Qumran community.<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-8" href="#endnote-chapter4-8">8</a></sup> And these texts are only the earliest evidence of a pattern of systematic cosmological speculation in Jewish tradition, often presented as exegesis of <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier248" href="#index_entry_genesis_1"/>Genesis 1, that continued to assume new forms through the Byzantine and medieval periods.<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-9" href="#endnote-chapter4-9">9</a></sup></p>

<p>Was there a Jewish <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier249" href="#index_entry_apocalypticism"/>“apocalyptic science,” as Jacob Taubes boldly proposed in 1947? These cases of serious interest in mathematics and astronomy raises the question of whether the Hellenistic period represented the dawn of a kind of scientific thought in Judaism. <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier250" href="#index_entry_demarcation"/><a class="ff" href="#ier266"/>It is clear that <i>something </i>new was dawning, for which current historical frameworks are not quite adequate.</p>

<p>For example, while <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier251" href="#index_entry_hellenism"/>Hellenization is a common way of how new ideas emerged in early Jewish literature, it is not possible to explain the new Jewish interest in mathematics and astronomy through Greek influence. This is because it mainly draws on elements that had existed in the ancient Near East for centuries before its emergence in texts of the third century BCE. <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier252" href="#index_entry_aramaic_in_babylonia"/>The new material first appears in Aramaic, not Greek; it is in a dialect—Standard Literary Aramaic—formed already in the Persian period; and it derives directly from a Babylonian scientific tradition that was itself one of the main influences on <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier253" href="#index_entry_astronomy_greek"/>early Greek mathematics and astronomy.<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-10" href="#endnote-chapter4-10">10</a></sup> Since this new phase of Jewish thought cannot be explained as a result of the Hellenization that has been so central to our explanations of other major changes in Judaism, from the rise of Rabbinic Judaism to Christianity, we need to seek other explanations.</p>

<p>Taubes argued for the idea of an <a class="index_entry_reference_no_print" id="ier254" href="#index_entry_apocalypticism"/>“apocalyptic science” in a German dissertation that was more or less neglected in the study of early Judaism and <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier255" href="#index_entry_hellenism"/>Hellenistic history. But in the past decade, the idea has reemerged as scholars begun to suggest that a new form of Jewish thought appeared in the Enochic literature. Philip Alexander was the first to argue in detail that “the approach to nature displayed in the <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier256" href="#index_entry_enoch_books_astronomcal"/>Enochic <i>Book of the Heavenly Luminaries </i>is unprecedented in Jewish literature. It seems to mark a turning-point in Jewish intellectual history—the emergence, for the first time, of what <a class="index_entry_reference_no_print" id="ier257" href="#index_entry_demarcation"/>might properly be called a scientific attitude.”<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-11" href="#endnote-chapter4-11">11</a></sup></p>

<p>Alexander’s argument reopened the discussion after Taubes, challenging us to ask new questions appropriate to our data. He has been followed by Jonathan Ben-Dov and Annette Reed, who have each added significant arguments for integrating early Jewish discourse about numbers, the body, and the stars into the history of science.<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-12" href="#endnote-chapter4-12">12</a></sup> As the great Otto Neugebauer pointed out, ancient science is especially useful to the cultural historian because it often used highly distinctive, originally Babylonian methods, the trajectory of which can be traced across languages and cultures.<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-13" href="#endnote-chapter4-13">13</a></sup> <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier258" href="#index_entry_cuneiform"/>For example, the Babylonian cuneiform writing system used a base-60 number system (in contrast to the Hebrew and Greek base-10 system) and a “linear zigzag function” for calculating the length of the day (in which the longest day of the year is assumed to have a 2:1 proportion of hours of light to hours of darkness, and the shortest day is conversely assumed to have a 1:2 proportion). Because these conventions are both distinctive and arbitrary, they are easily recognizable across languages and texts and give us reliable evidence for the origins and direction of intercultural contact. Ben-Dov used the linear zigzag function, among a number of features, to deduce the precise nature and time period of the <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier259" href="#index_entry_astrology_babylonian"/>Babylonian astronomy used in the <a class="index_entry_reference_no_print" id="ier260" href="#index_entry_enoch_books_astronomcal"/><i>Astronomical Book</i> of Enoch, and Drawnel was similarly able to show that the base-60 calculations in the <i>Aramaic Levi Document</i> had to have a Babylonian origin. The patterns shared between Babylonian, Jewish and later Greek texts pay a further dividend because they force us to rethink old and perhaps inappropriate analytical categories. As we shall see, the astronomical material in Enoch cannot be categorized as “law,” “prophecy,” “wisdom” or “religion.”</p>

<p><a class="index_entry_reference_no_print" id="ier261" href="#index_entry_demarcation"/>But is “science” the best category for organizing this body of data? Along with a lucid analysis, Alexander provided his own definition of science. Reed and Ben-Dov also proposed brief characterizations, each differing from the other.<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-14" href="#endnote-chapter4-14">14</a></sup> And this points to a problem. As we show in the introduction to this volume, when one compares the divergent reasons scholars have given for why texts like the <i>Astronomical Book </i>should be called science, it is easier to agree that it is science than to specify why.</p>

<p>The new types of knowledge that emerged in Hellenistic Jewish culture were heterogenous. They included astronomical calculations of the movements of the heavenly bodies and length of the days, sexagesimal (base-60) mathematics, and <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier262" href="#index_entry_physiognomy_babylonian"/>physiognomic interpretation of the body. On the one hand, all of these modes of knowledge have at some point in modern European history been understood as natural science: astronomy and mathematics are of course still understood this way. But as late as the mid-19th-century a form of physiognomy known as “phrenology” was still taken seriously by scholars across Europe.<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-15" href="#endnote-chapter4-15">15</a></sup> It seems intuitively correct to us to define mathematics and astronomy as exact science, but is it science to observe someone’s hair to predict their character and destiny, as the <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier263" href="#index_entry_physiognomy_at_qumran"/>Qumran physiognomic text 4Q186 does?<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-16" href="#endnote-chapter4-16">16</a></sup> What is surprising is how clear the verdict of the history and philosophy of science is on this point: there is simply no rigorous way to tell whether a discipline is science or not.</p>

<p><a class="index_entry_reference_no_print" id="ier264" href="#index_entry_demarcation"/>In an influential 1983 article, the philosopher of science Larry Laudan explained that the problem of distinguishing scientific knowledge from other types has loomed large in Western philosophy for a long time: “From Plato to Popper, philosophers have sought to identify those epistemic features which mark off science from other sorts of belief and activity.”<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-17" href="#endnote-chapter4-17">17</a></sup> In the philosophy of science, the task of defining the boundaries of science became known as the “demarcation problem,” and after well over a century of heated debate it is now generally agreed to be insoluble. “… it is probably fair to say that there is no demarcation line between science and non-science, or between science and pseudo-science, which would win assent from a majority of philosophers” (112).</p>

<p>Historically, nobody seems to have ever produced a necessary and sufficient definition of science (or its ancestors such as Aristotle’s <i>episteme</i>). As Laudan explains, definitions have at some points focused on science as proceeding deductively from <i>a priori</i> principles and at other points as proceeding inductively from observed phenomena. Science has also been defined as being “falsifiable” (a definition that includes the flat earth theory) or as proceeding from a “scientific method” (the rules of which were never successfully explained). And as Francesca Rochberg has shown, ancient science was also defined in contradictory ways. It has been described as explanation without accurate <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier265" href="#index_entry_observation"/>observation (Greek), or accurate observation without explanation (Mesopotamia and Egypt).<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-18" href="#endnote-chapter4-18">18</a></sup></p>

<p>The problem is not that no useful <a class="index_entry_reference_no_print" id="ier266" href="#index_entry_demarcation"/>criteria for science are possible, but that historically, there have been so many of them. These criteria concern something immensely important to the people who proposed them—the nature of reliable knowledge of the world. So while it may be ironic that the question, “is it science?” does not admit of a “scientific” (or at least universally valid) answer, it is precisely the persistence of the question that can provide a useful starting point. Rather than trying to place our texts into an anachronistic modern category, we must first find out how biblical and early Jewish writers themselves depicted systematic knowledge of the physical world.</p>

<p>The following investigation will adopt a provisional, heuristic definition: “science” will be understood as a system of exact knowledge of the physical world. This will let us compare a usefully large, but delimited, group of corpora. It will let us investigate what counted as reliable knowledge of the physical world for the ancient Jewish writers of Enoch: did they presuppose the Classical opposition between <i>physis</i> “nature” and <i>nomos</i> “culture,” i.e. what is physically given in the <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier1172" href="#index_entry_cosmos"/>cosmos and body, versus humanly given norms? If they did not presuppose such oppositions, then what, if anything, separated their astronomy from other forms of systematic technical knowledge such as law? Similarly, we will ask how their knowledge of the physical world was opposed or related to categories usually associated with religion, such as ritual, for example in the forms of knowledge laid out in Priestly texts and later Qumran works of <i>halakha</i>. <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier267" href="#index_entry_priests_priestly_literature"/><a class="ff" href="#ier294"/>Did our writers differentiate between cosmic and ritual knowledge, rather than claiming, for example, that God created a seamless network of nature and culture? As we shall see, Enoch’s authors inherited a set of texts that did not assume an essential difference between nature and culture, but rather work on a set of homologies between what is created and what is commanded.</p>

<p>Finally, this intellectual shift will only acquire its full meaning in a historical and cultural context, but we must move forward incrementally in reconstructing one, attentive to what the sources are best suited to tell us. We still lack first-hand information about the people who produced the early Enochic literature. In response, scholars have so far reconstruct a cultural and historical setting based on attitudes and allusions reflected in the texts.<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-19" href="#endnote-chapter4-19">19</a></sup></p>

<p>What we can be sure of is that these early Jewish writers inherited a set of biblical categories, but transformed them to accommodate Babylonian science.<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-20" href="#endnote-chapter4-20">20</a></sup> Their scientific sources emerged from an old cosmopolitan Mesopotamian world of exact descriptive knowledge, one that had existed for centuries in <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier268" href="#index_entry_cuneiform"/>cuneiform, and then Aramaic, independent of Priestly and Deuteronomistic categories.<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-21" href="#endnote-chapter4-21">21</a></sup> Since there are no biblical genres of mathematics or astronomy, and <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier269" href="#index_entry_magic_and_divination"/>divination is taboo, the extensive use of <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier270" href="#index_entry_astronmy_babylonian"/>Babylonian astral science in <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier271" href="#index_entry_aramaic_in_babylonia"/><a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier272" href="#index_entry_aramaic_at_qumran"/>Aramaic texts at Qumran could potentially appear as a radical break within Judaism.<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-22" href="#endnote-chapter4-22">22</a></sup></p>

<p>Yet when Babylonian material appears in Enoch it seems to occasion no break at all; it is presented in terms of the inherited biblical categories of knowledge. This itself is a valuable clue to the cultural world in which our writers lived. We do not know the full range of texts that Second Temple Jewish scribes had available to them.<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-23" href="#endnote-chapter4-23">23</a></sup> But biblical texts are the most solid ground on which we can begin a description of their intellectual framework. We can be certain that they were aware of biblical texts containing exact descriptions of the cosmos, temple, and human phenomena. It is to these texts that we now turn to provide some of the background for Enoch’s new knowledge.</p>


<h3>2. Created and Commanded, Nature and Culture: Priestly Categories and their Legacy</h3>

<p>Because they provide the most exact chronological framework of the Pentateuch and contain the most extended discussions of the physical world, <a class="index_entry_reference_no_print" id="ier273" href="#index_entry_priests_priestly_literature"/>Priestly texts are a reliable starting point for considering the scientific background of <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier274" href="#index_entry_enoch_books_astronomcal"/><i>Astronomical Enoch</i>. As knowledge of the physical world, the material in Enoch would have been understood in light of three major corpora, concerning 1) <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier275" href="#index_entry_calendar"/>time and the universe, 2) the temple, and 3) the human body. These are contained in the creation account of <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier276" href="#index_entry_genesis_1"/>Genesis 1-2:4a, the temple revelation of Exodus 25-31 (cf. <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier277" href="#index_entry_exodus_25_31"/>Ex 35-40 and Ezekiel 40-48), and <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier278" href="#index_entry_leviticus"/><a class="ff" href="#ier283"/>Leviticus 12-15, with its command to observe physical signs to diagnose them, as it were, as symptoms of a ritual state, primarily the form of impurity manifested in the disease <span xml:lang="hbo">צרעת</span>.<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-24" href="#endnote-chapter4-24">24</a></sup></p>

 <p>The Hebrew Bible begins with the <a class="index_entry_reference_no_print" id="ier279" href="#index_entry_priests_priestly_literature"/>Priestly account of the origins of the physical world, a pointedly taxonomic narrative in which each major sort of thing in the world is created, category by category.<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-25" href="#endnote-chapter4-25">25</a></sup> This creation account ends by narrating how a seven-day ritual week is built into the structure of the <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier1173" href="#index_entry_cosmos"/>cosmos (Gen 2:2-3). It is God’s speech that performatively completes the cosmos with a verbally sanctified cycle of seven days, which fact is transmitted by an anonymous Priestly author as the definitive account of creation. Similarly, in a ritual text which appears to have been shared by both the Deuteronomistic and Priestly schools (Lev 11, Dtr 14), the prohibition on eating creatures derives directly from their observable physical characteristics: the category of “unclean” (<span xml:lang="hbo">טמא</span>) completely overlaps with the category of “abominable” (<span xml:lang="hbo">תועבה</span> in D)<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-26" href="#endnote-chapter4-26">26</a></sup> and therefore prohibited in Dtr 14:3-20. In both cases, Priestly texts present the pattern of divine <i>commands </i>as homologous with the pattern of divine <i>creation</i>.</p>

<p>The idea that animals have different inherent types of physical nature is broadly-based in the Hebrew Bible, appearing in narrative as well as ritual sources. In addition to D it appears not just in P (<a class="index_entry_reference_no_print" id="ier280" href="#index_entry_leviticus"/>Lev 11:2-28, analyzed below, as well as Lev 27:11, 27) but also in J (Gen 7:2, 8), and P’s continuator H (Num 18:15). As Naphtali Meshel writes, the appearance of this opposition in the J version of the <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier281" href="#index_entry_flood"/>flood story implies a strong claim about the nature of the created world. The idea implicit in the sources is that the clean-unclean differentiation that modern scholars would see as cultural is in fact based in physical nature:</p>

<blockquote>the distinction between pure and impure animal species is no innovation of Israelite religion, but was recognized in antediluvian times. Furthermore, since Noah is intuitively familiar with it, YHWH has no need to enumerate the pure and impure species. Thus it appears that the distinction does not stem from a divine decree, but rather from naturally inherent traits, easily discernible by any human being, Israelite and non-Israelite alike.<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-27" href="#endnote-chapter4-27">27</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>Yet a contrast between nature and culture does arise within a later strand of biblical literature about the physical world. <a class="index_entry_reference_no_print" id="ier282" href="#index_entry_priests_priestly_literature"/>Meshel demonstrates how a nature/ culture opposition was editorially <i>added into </i>the structure of a Priestly text—in the redaction of Leviticus 11 and in opposition to the parallel set of regulations from a shared <i>Vorlage</i> in Deuteronomy 14:4-20.<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-28" href="#endnote-chapter4-28">28</a></sup> In the Priestly portions of the text, Lev 11:1-42, 46-47<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-29" href="#endnote-chapter4-29">29</a></sup> the editor introduced two distinct negative categories of creatures: <span xml:lang="hbo">שקץ</span> “prohibited for consumption” and <span xml:lang="hbo">טמא</span> “impure, ritually defiling.” The distinction between the two means that not every animal that is prohibited for consumption is considered ritually impure. For example, among the <span class="hboproblem" xml:lang="hbo">שרץ</span> “swarming creatures” on land, which are all prohibited, only eight types are designated impure in <a class="index_entry_reference_no_print" id="ier283" href="#index_entry_leviticus"/>Lev 11:29-30. Similarly, and remarkably, not every animal that is impure is prohibited for consumption! Lev 11:39-40 explain that if a permitted quadruped dies of itself, it is ritually defiling—but may be eaten, with only the routine, day-long impurity (<span xml:lang="hbo">וטמא עד הערב</span>) which is assumed as a matter of course in daily life according to <a class="index_entry_reference_no_print" id="ier284" href="#index_entry_priests_priestly_literature"/>P.</p>

<p>Thus the old dichotomy of pure and permitted versus impure and prohibited is replaced with a four-part grid: pure and permitted, pure and prohibited, impure and permitted, impure and prohibited.<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-30" href="#endnote-chapter4-30">30</a></sup> This new division was not practical. Because Lev 11’s configuration of laws focuses on improbable situations and foodstuffs, it appears to have been conceptual, rather than normative.</p>

<p>This editorial rethinking of Leviticus 11 is a sign of an emergent speculative strand within Priestly thought that has begun to treat created and commanded categories separately. It stands in contrast with an older conceptual framework, shared across multiple biblical sources, that sees created and commanded as homologous, at least with respect to the categorization of animals.<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-31" href="#endnote-chapter4-31">31</a></sup> The two different biblical treatments of created and commanded orders suggests that Second Temple Judaism inherited more than one theory dealing with the issues of <i>physis </i>and <i>nomos</i>, nature and culture. It is within the Priestly tradition that signs of a rethinking emerge, against the default <a class="index_entry_reference_no_print" id="ier285" href="#index_entry_priests_priestly_literature"/>biblical taxonomy of animals in which commanded is homologous with created.</p>

<p>How did these biblical taxonomies of the cosmos, temple and body which early Judaism inherited cohere? It has been convincingly argued that the Priestly writers saw cosmos and temple as homologous in essential ways; H emphasizes the parallel thus:</p>

<p><span xml:lang="hbo">את-שבתתי תשמרו ומקדשי תיראו אני יהוה</span> “My Sabbaths you shall observe/And my sanctuary you shall revere: I am the Lord.”<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-32" href="#endnote-chapter4-32">32</a></sup> The human body represents the third term in this homology: humans exist within and serve as well as endanger both cosmos (Gen 6:12-13) and temple (Lev 16).<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-33" href="#endnote-chapter4-33">33</a></sup></p>

<p>If the Priestly strand of the Pentateuch contains exact descriptive knowledge of the <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier1175" href="#index_entry_cosmos"/>cosmos, temple, and body, they are not presented symmetrically. The first corpus is brief and unlike the latter two it is presented by an anonymous narrator, not God. This Priestly discourse begins with the narrator’s treatise on the creation and structure of the cosmos—ordered through God’s speech into binary divisions of things and a temporal cycle of seven (<a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier286" href="#index_entry_genesis_1"/>Gen 1-2:4a; again, contrast <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier287" href="#index_entry_deuteronomy_4"/>Dtr’s warning against attention to and divinization of celestial phenomena in Dtr 4:19). This narrative is not spoken by God but consists chiefly of instances of God’s speech narrated by an anonymous voice.</p>

 <p>The second corpus, about the temple, has a drastically different epistemology than the first. It is framed as a divine speech that goes into extensive detail on the precise measurements and materials of the <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier288" href="#index_entry_tabernacle"/><a class="ff" href="#ier312"/>tabernacle, the ritual prototype of the temple, and its implements (Ex 25-31). Remarkably, it presents its information not as words but as a visual model (<span xml:lang="hbo">תבנית</span><bdi dir="ltr">):<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-34" href="#endnote-chapter4-34">34</a></sup></bdi></p>

<blockquote class="right"><span xml:lang="hbo">ככל אשר אני מראה אותך את תבנית המשכן ואת תבנית כל-כליו וכן תעשו</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“Exactly as I am <b>showing</b> you—the pattern of the Tabernacle and the pattern of all its furnishings—so shall you make it.</blockquote>

<p>Note that here Moses does not “see” the <span xml:lang="hbo">תבנית</span> on his own, but rather God causatively shows him, in the <i>hiphil</i> of the standard Biblical Hebrew verb of seeing, <span xml:lang="hbo">ראה</span>. Moses’ visions of the Tabernacle imply a different epistemology within the Priestly source. All descriptions of these visions are marked by being narrated with syntactically passive forms. <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier289" href="#index_entry_exodus_25_31"/>Ex 25:40 reads:</p>

<blockquote class="right"><span xml:lang="hbo">וראה ועשה בתבניתם אשר-אתה מראה בהר</span></blockquote>

<p>“See, and make, according to their pattern which you are <b>being shown</b> on the mountain,” using a <i>hophal</i>, the grammatical passive of the causative.</p>

<p>Moses is then <i>shown </i>a rule: Ex 26:30 reads:</p>

<blockquote class="right"><span class="hboproblem" xml:lang="hbo">והקמת את-המשכן כמשפטו אשר הראית בהר</span></blockquote>

<p>“Then set up the Tabernacle according to its rule, that you <b>were shown</b> on the mountain,” also with <i>hophal</i>.</p>

<p>Finally, Ex 27:8 narrates Moses’ vision with a morphologically active but pragmatically passive <i>hiphil</i>:</p>

<blockquote class="right"><span xml:lang="hbo">נבוב לחת תעשה אתו כאשר הראה אתך בהר כן יעשו</span></blockquote>

<p>“Make it hollow, of boards. As you <b>were shown</b><sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-35" href="#endnote-chapter4-35">35</a></sup> on the mountain, so shall they make it.”</p>

<p>The vast majority of the <a class="index_entry_reference_no_print" id="ier290" href="#index_entry_priests_priestly_literature"/>Priestly work and Deuteronomy consists of scenes where Moses <i>hears </i>God’s instructions; but for Moses to <i>see </i>God’s instructions requires a special sort of language. The power relationship is made evident in the text’s morphology and syntax. The special grammar of seeing in the <a class="index_entry_reference_no_print" id="ier291" href="#index_entry_tabernacle"/>tabernacle vision has the result of denying Moses’ epistemological agency: he does not even see the tabernacle under his own power, but rather is passively <i>shown </i>by God.<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-36" href="#endnote-chapter4-36">36</a></sup></p>

<p>Finally, the Priestly corpus’ first set of instructions for ritual in the tablernacle ends with a manual for the <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier292" href="#index_entry_observation"/><a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier293" href="#index_entry_leviticus"/><a class="ff" href="#ier297"/>observation and ritual response to discharges and affections of the human body (Lev 12-15). Unlike the tabernacle vision, the rules for discharges have a known, earthly object: the human body. They are therefore made known as verbal commands, not as a report about a passive vision of a heavenly model. Since the reader is not privileged to see the <span xml:lang="hbo">תבנית</span> (visual model) Moses saw, both the tabernacle vision and the rules for discharges end up presented in words. The literary corpus of P transmits both of the latter to the reader entirely in divine direct discourse.</p>

<p>The point to take away from different framing of exact knowledge within the <a class="index_entry_reference_no_print" id="ier294" href="#index_entry_priests_priestly_literature"/>Priestly corpus is that there is a gap in how the three orders of knowledge are presented as being learned—the second two, about the <a class="index_entry_reference_no_print" id="ier295" href="#index_entry_tabernacle"/>tabernacle and the body, are framed as revealed, spoken or shown by God to be passed on by a human speaker. By contrast, the first corpus, about the cosmos, is not explicitly claimed to be revealed. This corresponds to the practical ritual function of the second two, which are represented as divinely spoken commands to be enacted word for word by humans: the temple and the body are sites on which humans act ritually, while the cosmos cannot be acted upon by humans; rather, it sets the scene for all ritual. The construction of the temple and the treatment of pure and impure human bodies are chartered differently from creation.</p>

<p><a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier296" href="#index_entry_demarcation"/>If the opposition of “science” and “religion” is anachronistic for early Jewish texts, how can we move beyond discard the misleading old binarism? As we have seen in the case of <a class="index_entry_reference_no_print" id="ier297" href="#index_entry_leviticus"/>Lev 11, we cannot assume that native categories of knowledge were uniform or stable even within a coherent corpus such as the Priestly work: there are different ways knowledge is said to be mediated, and different relationships between created and commanded orders.<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-37" href="#endnote-chapter4-37">37</a></sup> What new analytical categories better organize the data? If we cannot find a uniform opposition in ancient Priestly (or, perhaps, Qumran) works between nature and culture, what separated their exact technical knowledge from law or ritual?</p>

<p>A solution to the question of what the new genres of Jewish knowledge had in common and how they patterned together may lie in attending to their status as knowledge, to precisely how they claimed to be known. In other words, to understand how ancient Jewish arts of knowledge may have been understood as sciences, it may be most helpful to focus not on an anachronistic modern concept of how scientific knowledge should be created, but on ancient concepts of how it was created. In the examples we have seen, these ancient discourses do claim that “the truth is out there” in the world, and that it becomes humanly known by <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier298" href="#index_entry_observation"/>observation or calculation. But as we will see, what may be most distinctively ancient and Jewish about Enochic science is its sense of non-human agency, one interestingly different from modern notions of scientific knowledge production.</p>

<h3>3. Revealed Science and Evidential Grammar in Early Enochic Literature</h3>

<p><a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier299" href="#index_entry_evidentials"/>The rise of new genres in early Judaism containing exact knowledge of the stars and body demands explanation.<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-38" href="#endnote-chapter4-38">38</a></sup> And any historical account of the rise of these forms will need to account for their connections to old ones. Otherwise we risk turning the Hellenistic period into a black box, the distinctiveness of which is predicated on an inexplicable paradigm shift in the status of <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier300" href="#index_entry_alien_wisdom"/><a class="ff" href="#ier306"/>foreign knowledge and text genres.<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-39" href="#endnote-chapter4-39">39</a></sup> We want a description fine-grained enough to account for the specificity of the forms this new knowledge takes, but broad enough to account for both their connections with and breaks from older ones.</p>

<p>Jonathan Ben-Dov has suggested one promising way of seeing new “scientific” genres of exact descriptive knowledge as continuous with earlier biblical ones: through the reshaping of genres. A striking feature of the oldest known Hellenistic Jewish scientific text, the <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier301" href="#index_entry_enoch_books_astronomcal"/><a class="ff" href="#ier320"/><i>Astronomical Book</i> of Enoch, is its narrativization. An older, factual description of the layout and cycles of the <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier1177" href="#index_entry_cosmos"/>cosmos appears to have been edited into a story involving <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier302" href="#index_entry_enoch_culture_hero"/>Enoch.<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-40" href="#endnote-chapter4-40">40</a></sup> As Ben-Dov notes, the <i>Astronomical Book</i> is not alone here, but shares the fact of narrative presentation with the other two oldest known Qumran texts presenting exact knowledge, the <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier303" href="#index_entry_enoch_books_watchers"/><i>Book of Watchers</i> and the <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier304" href="#index_entry_aramaic_levi_document"/>Aramaic Levi Document: “Whereas the three early scientific writings are embedded within literary frameworks and presented as part of a comprehensive patriarchal teaching, the three later items [4Q561, <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier305" href="#index_entry_4q318"/>4Q318, and 4Q560] lack a clear extra-scientific framework.”<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-41" href="#endnote-chapter4-41">41</a></sup> The narrative framing of exact knowledge thus did not merely legitimate a form of previously <a class="index_entry_reference_no_print" id="ier306" href="#index_entry_alien_wisdom"/>alien wisdom: it provided a new context and set of connections for its meaning and use.</p>

<p>The narrative framing of new knowledge in <i>Astronomical Enoch</i> is illuminating for two reasons: for the continuities it creates with earlier literature, and for the epistemological claims it makes about the knowledge it presents. The continuity it creates is clear: the angel Uriel shows Enoch the cycles of the universe, making astronomy into the content of revelation. This reframing creates a symmetry with the narrative framing of two of our three earlier corpora of exact Priestly knowledge: in the revelation of the Tabernacle’s heavenly model (<span xml:lang="hbo">תבנית</span>) and the Levitical rules for the observation and categorization of disease. But these Priestly revelations were, not accidentally, about the temple and body—not the cosmos. Here is where <i>Astronomical Enoch</i> creates something new: for the first time in a known Jewish text, astronomy is presented by a divine being, the angel Uriel. Thus the editors of <i>Astronomical Enoch</i> did not so much rupture as fill out the Priestly paradigm they inherited; P had framed exact cosmic knowledge in Genesis as spoken by a narrator, not God. <i>Astronomical Enoch’s</i> presentation of exact cosmic knowledge as revealed makes it symmetrical with the earlier <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier307" href="#index_entry_priests_priestly_literature"/>P presentations of revealed exact knowledge about the temple and body.</p>

<p>But precisely how was Enoch said to gain this <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier308" href="#index_entry_revealed_knowledge"/>revealed cosmic knowledge? A paradoxical phrase, preserved in the <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier309" href="#index_entry_aramaic_at_qumran"/><a class="ff" href="#ier344"/>Aramaic of the <a class="index_entry_reference_no_print" id="ier310" href="#index_entry_enoch_books_astronomcal"/><i>Astronomical Book</i>, allows us to be more precise about the epistemological status claimed for the astronomy revealed to Enoch.</p>

<p>It seems that many of the new pieces of <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier311" href="#index_entry_astrology_babylonian"/>Babylonian astronomical knowledge that Enoch learns in the <i>Astronomical Book</i> parallel the passive syntax of Moses’ <a class="index_entry_reference_no_print" id="ier312" href="#index_entry_tabernacle"/>tabernacle vision. They are framed as <span xml:lang="hbo">חשבון אחרן אחזית</span> “I was shown another calculation.”<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-42" href="#endnote-chapter4-42">42</a></sup> Grammatically a verbal phrase based on the 1cs internal passive <i>aphel </i>suffix form of <span xml:lang="hbo">חזי</span> (most likely to be vocalized <i>ʾoḥzayit</i> or <i>ʾaḥzayit</i>),<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-43" href="#endnote-chapter4-43">43</a></sup> it has the remarkable feature of taking the Hebrew loanword <span xml:lang="hbo">חשבון</span> “calculation, reckoning” as an object.<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-44" href="#endnote-chapter4-44">44</a></sup> Here we see the prime experiential categories of observation and calculation brought together in a distinctive new way. The mathematical formulae are not calculated, but the calculation (like the tabernacle’s <span xml:lang="hbo">משפט</span>) is <i>shown</i> to Enoch—an account that stands in sharp contrast with <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier313" href="#index_entry_pseudo_eupolemus"/>Pseudo-Eupolemus’ claim that Enoch “discovered” (with <i>eurisko</i>) astrology.<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-45" href="#endnote-chapter4-45">45</a></sup></p>

<p>What is more, this phrase is not merely a part of the editorial framework of the <a class="index_entry_reference_no_print" id="ier314" href="#index_entry_enoch_books_astronomcal"/><i>Astronomical Book</i>; it is grammatically parallel with the way new pieces of mythical cosmic geography are introduced in Enoch’s otherworldly journey in the <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier315" href="#index_entry_enoch_books_watchers"/><i>Book of Watchers</i>, <span xml:lang="hbo">אחזית טור אחרן</span> “I was shown another mountain,” a phrase that appears in the singular or plural at least three times in the preserved <a class="index_entry_reference_no_print" id="ier316" href="#index_entry_aramaic_at_qumran"/>Aramaic portions corresponding to Enoch’s second otherworldly journey:</p>

<p>Most remarkably—and in contrast to the <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier317" href="#index_entry_enoch_ethiopic_tradition"/>Ethiopic, which does not consistently preserve the phrase “I was shown (an)other mountain(s)”, what we see here is an editorial framing device shared between the <i>Book of Watchers</i> and the <i>Astronomical Book</i>.<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-47" href="#endnote-chapter4-47">47</a></sup> What is more, 4Q204 is the earliest clear evidence for a <i>collection </i>of books of Enoch since its fragments represent not only the <i>Book of Watchers</i> but also the <i>Dream Visions</i> and <i>Epistle</i>.<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-48" href="#endnote-chapter4-48">48</a></sup> We find that the editors of this earliest collection of Enochic works drew on the image, and grammar, of Moses’ passively gained vision (with the passive of the causative of the standard Biblical Hebrew verb of seeing) to frame Enoch’s own passively gained visions (with the passive of the causative of the standard Aramaic verb of seeing).</p>

<p>If the use of <i>aphel</i> passives of <span xml:lang="hbo">חזי</span> to frame revealed knowledge is both a calque from the <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier318" href="#index_entry_priests_priestly_literature"/>Priestly <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier319" href="#index_entry_tabernacle"/>Tabernacle vision and a distinctive editorial device shared between the <a class="index_entry_reference_no_print" id="ier320" href="#index_entry_enoch_books_astronomcal"/><i>Astronomical Book</i> and the <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier321" href="#index_entry_enoch_books_watchers"/><i>Book of Watchers</i>, then the Aramaic evidence bears on two old questions about the composition and editing of early Enochic literature. First, it means that the creators of this early literature drew more heavily on the language and imagery of the Pentateuch than has previously been acknowledged.</p>

<p>Categorical statements such as that of George Nickelsburg in his Enoch commentary that apart from Genesis “the rest of the Pentateuch is of little interest to the Enochic authors” will need to be revised.<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-49" href="#endnote-chapter4-49">49</a></sup> Second, Randall Chesnutt recently reported the important discovery that <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier322" href="#index_entry_p_oxy_2069"/>Oxyrhynchus 2069, the earliest Greek manuscript of Enoch, dating from the early 4th century CE and thus at least a century older than the earliest <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier323" href="#index_entry_enoch_ethiopic_tradition"/>Ethiopic version, represents a tradition in which the <i>Book of Watchers</i> was copied together with the <i>Astronomical Book</i>.<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-50" href="#endnote-chapter4-50">50</a></sup> But the editorial pattern discussed here in the 3rd-century BCE Qumran fragments suggests that the connection between these books may well be no less than 6 centuries earlier!</p>

<p>Despite the significance of the discovery of the original Aramaic version of 1 Enoch at Qumran, no modern edition of the books of Enoch makes this data about the editorial framing of its visions available to the reader. Because they prefer to base their readings on the fully preserved <a class="index_entry_reference_no_print" id="ier324" href="#index_entry_enoch_ethiopic_tradition"/>Ethiopic manuscripts, Isaac’s English translation of the Ethiopic Ms. Kebran 9, Nickelsburg and Vanderkam’s English translation, and Uhlig’s German translation all typically render “I saw.” Disturbingly, the only edition that consistently presents the actual readings of the original sources is Milik’s <i>editio princeps </i>of the <a class="index_entry_reference_no_print" id="ier325" href="#index_entry_aramaic_at_qumran"/>Aramaic fragments.<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-51" href="#endnote-chapter4-51">51</a></sup> This renders the fragmentary but consistent evidence of the Aramaic—and thus a clue to the texts’ editing, biblical referents, and epistemology—invisible.<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-52" href="#endnote-chapter4-52">52</a></sup></p>

<p>The <a class="index_entry_reference_no_print" id="ier326" href="#index_entry_aramaic_at_qumran"/>Aramaic (as well as its antecedent Biblical Hebrew) grammar has epistemological consequences for the analysis of early Jewish views of exact knowledge. Obviously, Enoch’s visions are a mode of <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier327" href="#index_entry_revealed_knowledge"/><a class="ff" href="#ier358"/>revelation (they are involuntary, with a divine cause, using the same <i>aphel</i> first person passive of the <span xml:lang="hbo">חזי</span> root as appears for the visionary revelation of heaven in the <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier328" href="#index_entry_aramaic_levi_document"/>Aramaic Levi Document<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-53" href="#endnote-chapter4-53">53</a></sup>). But there is a more specific epistemic value that vision has.</p>

<p>In contrast to Biblical Hebrew, where the <span xml:lang="hbo">חזי</span> verbal form represents a marked term for “seeing,” often of dubious truth, in Standard Literary Aramaic <span xml:lang="hbo">חזי</span> is the unmarked, default verb for “to see.” Aramaic verbal phrases with <span xml:lang="hbo">חזי</span> encode strong claims about their statements they contain: the truth of any object that this verb of seeing takes is implied to be self-evident. In linguistics this category is known as an <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier329" href="#index_entry_evidentials"/>evidential, a morphological or lexical category that connotes the speaker’s assessment of the evidence for his or her statement.<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-54" href="#endnote-chapter4-54">54</a></sup> Verbs of seeing are sensory evidentials signaling that the speaker’s evidence for the truth of his or her statement is derived from the speaker’s own sight.<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-55" href="#endnote-chapter4-55">55</a></sup></p>

<p>Sensory evidentials play a crucial role in the arguments that the <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier330" href="#index_entry_enoch_books_watchers"/><a class="ff" href="#ier346"/><i>Book of Watchers</i> makes about human <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier331" href="#index_entry_observation"/><a class="ff" href="#ier356"/>observation of the physical world. The preserved fragments of the book’s introduction in 1 En 2-3 (4Q201 1 ii 1-3) evidence repeated play on the same verb of seeing, <span xml:lang="hbo">חזי</span>, that structures the presentation of astronomical calculations in the <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier332" href="#index_entry_enoch_books_astronomcal"/><i>Astronomical Book</i> and mountains in Enoch’s second otherworldly journey:</p>

<p>What does the language of knowledge in <a class="index_entry_reference_no_print" id="ier333" href="#index_entry_aramaic_at_qumran"/>Aramaic Enoch tell us about <a class="index_entry_reference_no_print" id="ier334" href="#index_entry_revealed_knowledge"/>revelation and science in early Judaism?

This is true not least because the very grammatical form of the texts, as well as their rhetorical style, entails that the subject of exact knowledge is both signs of divine order and something that God causes the knower to see. This editorial framing device and its evidential syntax subverts any opposition between revelation, as a mode of knowledge based on the claim “God revealed X,” as opposed to science as based on the claim “I observed or calculated X.”</p>

<p>The Aramaic phrase that introduces central units of astral knowledge in the <i>Astronomical Book</i> <span xml:lang="hbo">חשבון אחרן אחזית</span> “I was shown another calculation” implies a category that one could call revealed science, which bridges the gap: the calculations are Aramaic-Babylonian astronomy, but the agency belongs to the angel Uriel who caused Enoch to see the calculation. <span xml:lang="hbo">אחזית טור אחרן</span>, this phrase’s editorial parallel in the <a class="index_entry_reference_no_print" id="ier335" href="#index_entry_enoch_books_watchers"/><i>Book of Watchers</i>, lets us see one specific technique that the compilers of the earliest Enochic collection used to claim that mythic <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier336" href="#index_entry_geography"/>geography and astronomical mathematics had the same evidential status. <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier337" href="#index_entry_demarcation"/>If we understand science as knowledge gained from <a class="index_entry_reference_no_print" id="ier338" href="#index_entry_observation"/>observation and calculation, as opposed to revelation, we see an explicit incorporation (and subversion?) of all of these modes of knowledge in the framework that unified the earliest books of Enoch.</p>

<p>What was lost in <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier339" href="#index_entry_translation"/>translation from Aramaic to Greek and Ethiopic was a significant piece of the grammar of Enoch’s revealed, or apocalyptic, science. Echoing the syntax of the <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier340" href="#index_entry_priests_priestly_literature"/>Priestly account of Moses’ <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier341" href="#index_entry_tabernacle"/>tabernacle vision, this evidential phrase makes distinctive claims about human intellectual agency in what we would call scientific knowledge. Notably, these claims seem quite different from the claims made by Jewish writers in Greek such as <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier342" href="#index_entry_pseudo_eupolemus"/>Pseudo-Eupolemus, who attributes agency to the human mind when he says <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier343" href="#index_entry_enoch_culture_hero"/>Enoch “discovered” astrology. By contrast, the earliest Enochic books claim that Enoch only learns about the stars passively, in precisely the same way Moses learns about the Tabernacle. They argue that knowledge comes from a unity of three factors: not just observation and calculation, but observation, calculation and (divine) manipulation.<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-56" href="#endnote-chapter4-56">56</a></sup></p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Attention to the precise <a class="index_entry_reference_no_print" id="ier344" href="#index_entry_aramaic_at_qumran"/>Aramaic grammar of knowledge in Enochic literature, in contrast with its Hebrew Priestly forbears, gives us new evidence about the sources, composition, and epistemology of early Enochic literature. First, it corrects an earlier misunderstanding that Genesis was the main Pentateuchal source of Enoch’s language and ideas: in fact, the authors of the <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier345" href="#index_entry_enoch_books_astronomcal"/><i>Astronomical Book</i> and the <a class="index_entry_reference_no_print" id="ier346" href="#index_entry_enoch_books_watchers"/><i>Book of Watchers</i> reproduced the Priestly language of Exodus in the Tabernacle revelation, framing Enoch’s cosmic revelation with a phrase that represents the precise Aramaic equivalent of the <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier347" href="#index_entry_hebrew_language"/>Hebrew. This may have further bearing on the currently inconclusive debates about the <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier348" href="#index_entry_enoch_vs_moses"/>Mosaic, non-Mosaic, or anti-Mosaic nature of Enochic literature. Second, this shared editorial move provides evidence that the <i>Watchers</i> and the <i>Astronomical Book</i> were created with at least one of the same editorial techniques, already in the 3rd century BCE—at least 600 years before the earliest known manuscript evidence of this connection, in <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier349" href="#index_entry_p_oxy_2069"/>Oxyrhynchus 2069.</p>

<p><a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier350" href="#index_entry_demarcation"/>Finally, from an epistemological viewpoint: if we wish to use science as an analytical category in early Jewish thought—and I think we should—it will help to be specific about it. In what way did it count for ancient Jewish writers as authoritative knowledge of the physical world? What emerged at Qumran and later might best be understood as a <a class="index_entry_reference_no_print" id="ier351" href="#index_entry_revealed_knowledge"/>“revealed science”—exact knowledge of the created world framed as divine discourse, with the role of human agency suppressed. This distinctive framing may help explain both how it emerged in a way that could claim to be continuous with earlier authoritative Jewish genres, and why this conjuncture did not produce new <a class="index_entry_reference_no_print" id="ier352" href="#index_entry_observation"/>observations and calculations—its framing as revelation foreclosed these knowledge production mechanisms. But it would be the worst kind of anachronism to say it failed as science. Rather, it laid the foundation for a different, and quite productive, intellectual agenda.</p>

<p>I will conclude by returning to the provocative concept introduced by Jacob Taubes in his 1947 dissertation, <i>Abendländische Eschatologie</i>. It ties together some of the threads presented here, even as it opens up a further question. Taubes’ term—“apocalyptic science”—suggests why the <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier353" href="#index_entry_enoch_books_astronomcal"/><i>Astronomical Book</i> could have been both the earliest known Jewish scientific work and the earliest Jewish apocalypse. Taubes was not the only one to recognize that apocalyptic <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier354" href="#index_entry_calendar"/>calendars provided an intimate and regular connection between exact descriptive knowledge and political events—a form of knowledge that no modern definition seems to consider science. But he pointedly suggested that the real legacy of apocalyptic science may not have been in what we call science at all, but rather in a new vision of history:</p>

<blockquote>The events of the world are written on the face of the divine clock, so the point is to follow the course of world history to determine the hour of the aeon. <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier355" href="#index_entry_apocalypticism"/>Apocalypticism is the foundation which makes universal history possible.<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-57" href="#endnote-chapter4-57">57</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>What if the integration of exact knowledge with historiography was as essential as mathematics or <a class="index_entry_reference_no_print" id="ier356" href="#index_entry_observation"/>observation to the distinctiveness of early Jewish scientific thought? We would then need to consider whether Rochberg’s cutting remark, that “It may only be incidental that elements with affinities to modern science are to found within the boundaries of <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier357" href="#index_entry_astronmy_babylonian"/>Babylonian mathematical astronomy,” may apply equally to early Jewish thought.<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-58" href="#endnote-chapter4-58">58</a></sup></p>

<p>If so, the <a class="index_entry_reference_no_print" id="ier358" href="#index_entry_revealed_knowledge"/>revealed science of Enoch and Qumran may have even greater continuities with Mesopotamian scholarship, one crucial task of which was to study the stars in order to know the trajectory of politics. The Assyriologist Mario Fales has recently argued that already in the <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier359" href="#index_entry_neo_assyrian_neo_babylonian"/>Neo-Assyrian period, the practical effect of the “astronomical diaries,” which correlated astronomy with a chronicle of events on earth, was to link heavenly observation “with the concept of diachrony, and more widely with the flow of political and social history.”<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-59" href="#endnote-chapter4-59">59</a></sup> In this case the later trajectory of apocalyptic and universal history may represent a return to, more than a falling away from, the ancient Near Eastern intellectual roots of early Jewish science. And the task of understanding the terms on which ancient Jewish thinkers understood the physical universe and their place in it would then beckon to us with yet more promise.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX: Two Old Translations on Early Jewish “Science”</h3>

<p>It is important to be aware that the importation of the category “science” into ancient Jewish texts has a long history. If the scholarly characterizations of ancient science by Alexander, Reed, and Ben-Dov are examples of bringing the category into self-conscious reflection, it was often done so unselfconsciously in earlier scholarship. This is apparent in the tendency to insert the term “science” into <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier360" href="#index_entry_hellenism"/>Hellenistic Greek accounts of what Abraham taught the Egyptians, making it easy to see him as the “first scientist” without any analogous terms appearing in the texts. The first passage where this tendency can be obseved is in Wacholder’s translation of <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier361" href="#index_entry_pseudo_eupolemus"/>Pseudo-Eupolemus. The relevant fragment reads, <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier362" href="#index_entry_astrology_babylonian_in_greek_sources"/>in Greek and his translation,</p>

<blockquote><span xml:lang="grk">συζήσαντα δὲ τὸν Ἁβραὰμ ἐν Ἡλιουπόλει τοῖς Αἰγυπτίων ἱερεῦσι πολλὰ μεταδιδάξαι αὐτοὺς καὶ τὴν ἀστρολογίαν καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τοῦτον αὐτοῖς εἰσηγήσασθαι, φάμενον Βαβυλωνίους ταῦτα καὶ αὑτὸν εὑρηκέναι, τὴν δὲ εὕρεσιν αὐτῶν εἰς Ἐνὼχ ἀναπέμπειν, καὶ τοῦτον εὑρηκέναι πρῶτον τὴν ἀστρολογίαν, οὐκ Αἰγυπτίους.</span> (Eusebius, <i>Praep. Evang.</i> 9:8)</blockquote>

<blockquote>And Abraham lived with the Egyptian priests in Heliopolis, teaching them many things. And he introduced astrology and other sciences to them, saying that the Babylonians and he himself discovered them, but he traced the discovery to Enoch. And he (Enoch) was the first to discover astrology, not the Egyptians….<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-60" href="#endnote-chapter4-60">60</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>Wacholder’s rendering of the Greek <span xml:lang="grk">καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τοῦτον αὐτοῖς</span>, a phrase with the general sense of “<i>et cetera,</i>” as “and other sciences” very much begs the question of what category the things included fall into! The use of <i>eurisko</i> “find (out), discover, invent” to specify how Enoch learned astrology and other forms of knowledge is worth noting, since it attributes the agency to Enoch himself and not divine revelation—in stark contrast to what we will see in the <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier363" href="#index_entry_enoch_books_astronomcal"/><i>Astronomical Book</i>.<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-61" href="#endnote-chapter4-61">61</a></sup> A similar move appears in Whiston’s 1895 rendering of the parallel passage from <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier364" href="#index_entry_flavius_josephus"/>Josephus.</p>

<blockquote>τήν τε ἀριθμητικὴν αὐτοῖς χαρίζεται καὶ τὰ περὶ ἀστρονομίαν παραδίδωσι. [168] πρὸ γὰρ τῆς Ἁβράμου παρουσίας Αἰγύπτιοι τούτων εἶχον ἀμαθῶς: ἐκ Χαλδαίων γὰρ ταῦτ᾽ ἐφοίτησεν εἰς Αἴγυπτον, ὅθεν ἦλθε καὶ εἰς τοὺς Ἕλληνας. (Josephus, <i>Ant</i>. 1.167-168)</blockquote>

<blockquote>He communicated to them arithmetic, and delivered to them the science of astronomy; for before Abram came into Egypt they were unacquainted with those parts of learning; for that science came from the Chaldeans into Egypt, and from thence to the Greeks also …</blockquote>


<p>Here again the word is inserted (twice!), and Feldman’s more precise rendering avoids importing the category: “For these matters reached Egypt from the Chaldeans, from whence they came also to the Greeks.”<sup><a class="endnote_reference" id="endnote_reference-chapter4-62" href="#endnote-chapter4-62">62</a></sup></p>

<p>These examples are hardly exhaustive, but they do show how translators repeatedly—if not uniformly—caused ancient Jewish sources on astronomy and astrology to explicitly call them “science” when no parallel appears in the Greek. It may be possible to demonstrate that such a category does indeed stand behind <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier365" href="#index_entry_pseudo_eupolemus"/>Pseudo-Eupolemus and Josephus’ accounts, but such a demonstration would need to carefully tease this category out from existing Greek terms such as <i>tekhne</i>, a type of practical skill often associated with crafts like <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier366" href="#index_entry_technology"/>metalworking, and existing in tension with <i>episteme</i>, pure knowledge. Indeed, the fact that astronomy and astrology are taught along with metalworking, <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier367" href="#index_entry_medicine"/>medicine and <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier368" href="#index_entry_magic_and_divination"/>magic by the fallen angels in 1 Enoch 7-9 would suggest that a category such as <i>tekhne</i> may have been more natural.</p>

In a move strikingly relevant to the present discussion, but which cannot be pursued here, Steven Weitzman argues that this is part of a distinctive Deuteronomistic agenda for disciplining the senses. In this agenda, memory—but not visual evidence—is to be relied on for religious knowledge and practice. See his “Sensory Reform in Deuteronomy” in <i>Religion and the Self in Antiquity</i> (ed. David Brakke et al.; Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2005), 123-139, esp. 128-9. Weitzman’s arguments complicate the more standard understanding of the passage as “express[ing] clearly the fact that from biblical times on, Jewish faith has been based primarily on experience rather than speculative thought” (Jeffrey Tigay, <i>Deuteronomy</i> [Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1996] ad 4:9, with citation of A. J. Heschel). Weitzman’s arguments can be strengthened by a close reading of the passage in which the line appears, <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier371" href="#index_entry_deuteronomy_4"/>Deut 4:12-19. What is distinctive about the passage is its repeated stress on the nature of experience, and what claims follow from that sort of experience. The experience was, first of all, <i>auditory</i>: 4:12 and 4:15 state: “The Lord spoke to you out of the fire, and it was the sound of words you heard—you saw no image, only a sound. … So keep … watch over yourselves, since you saw no image when the Lord spoke to you out of the fire at Horeb …” Then the text warns of two dangerous misapprehensions, each involving acting on the evidence of one’s vision. Formally, both are expressed by “lest” plus a pair of subjunctive verbs joined hendiadically: “Lest you cause ruin by making (<span xml:lang="hbo">פן-תשחתון ועשיתם</span>) for yourselves a sculpted image …” (4:16) and “Lest you look up to the heavens and see” the heavenly bodies “and become scattered by bowing down (<span xml:lang="hbo">ונדחת והשתחוית</span>) to them and worshiping them …” (4:19). The first pathway to disaster is making a visible image and taking it as a divine being; the second pathway is seeing the visible images of the stars and taking them for divine beings. Now, Mesopotamian astronomy and astrology were based on the idea that the stars were in fact the visual evidence of gods, “heavenly writing,” in the Babylonian phrase (discussed by Rochberg in her book of the same name), in which a divine pattern could be read. In response to this, the Deuteronomic passage argues not that there is no writing in the heavens, but that it is dangerious to read. It is dangerous to read one’s visual experience of the sky, precisely because signs of the divine <i>may</i> be found there: evidence of more than one god. Contrast the account I give below of Priestly exact knowledge, in which visual evidence of both the <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier1180" href="#index_entry_cosmos"/>cosmos and human body are crucial.</p>
 <p class="endnote" id="endnote-chapter4-6"><a class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#endnote-chapter4-6">[☞ endnote-chapter4-6]</a> <a href="#endnote_reference-chapter4-6">6</a> Contra Hans-Peter Müller, the text of <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier372" href="#index_entry_daniel"/>Daniel is emphatic in contrasting the reliable knowledge <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier373" href="#index_entry_revealed_knowledge"/>revealed by God with the Mesopotamian court sages’ unreliable arts of knowledge (to use a term brought into biblical studies by Esther J. Hamori; see her <i>Women’s Divination in Biblical Literature: Prophecy, Necromancy, and Other Arts of Knowledge </i>f/c in the Yale Anchor Bible Reference Library). While it has been argued that Daniel’s techniques have a Mesopotamian provenance, the narrative of Daniel typically states the opposite, energetically opposing his knowledge to that of the court sages—with one exception. In an important treatment, Alan Lenzi has emphasized the contrast between Daniel, who receives revelation directly from God, and the Babylonian scholars who relies on written sources and sensory evidence, thus implicitly constrasting his successful “charismatic” performance with the scholars’ failed “institutionalized” practice. While generally convincing, Lenzi’s argument stumbles in forcing Daniel into a binary relationship with the Babylonian scholars; Daniel is actually presented as occupying multiple positions with respect to Mesopotamian scholarship that vary from insider to outsider. In fact, while Daniel is compared favorably to the Babylonian court scholars in Dan 1:19-20; 2:48; 4:8; 5:29; 6:28, he is only appointed over them at the end of Dan 2. By contrast, in Dan 4 he is introduced with both a Babylonian name and professional title: <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier374" href="#index_entry_dream_interpretation"/>“Belteshazar, chief dream-interpreter” <span xml:lang="hbo">בלטשאצר רב חרטמיא</span> (Dan 4:6), a designation that corresponds to a more elaborate title in the parallel version underlying the Old Greek. Here he is given his Jewish name but termed “chief of the sages and leader of the dream-interpreters” <span xml:lang="grc">τὸν ἄρχοντα τῶν σοφιστῶν καὶ τὸν ἡγούμενον τῶν κρινόντων</span> (4:15 in the Göttingen edition; for a useful treatment of the Old Greek and its relationship to the MT of Dan 4, see John Collins, <i>Daniel: A Commentary on the Book of Daniel</i> [Minneapolis: Fortress, 1993]). Dan 4 is the only part of the book to designate Daniel as a <i>Babylonian</i> expert from the outset, an anomaly most simply explained by its source, a Babylonian Aramaic legend of which an earlier version is preserved in 4Q242, the Prayer of Nabonidus. Here the figure who rescues the Babylonian king is simply termed “a diviner, a Jew” <span xml:lang="hbo">גזר והוא יהודי</span> <span dir="ltr">(1-3 4)</span>.

James VanderKam insightfully presents and analyzes the Qumran evidence in his “Mantic Wisdom in the Dead Sea Scrolls,” <i>DSD</i> 4 (1997): 336-353.

The two genres are distinct in Mesopotamian and biblical literature, and the features VanderKam analyzes in the scrolls do not fit neatly with the generic features of wisdom recently identified by Matthew Goff, “Qumran Wisdom Literature and the Problem of Genre,” <i>DSD</i> 17 (2010): 286-306. cf. the brief critique of Andreas Bedenbender, “Jewish Apocalypticism: A Child of Mantic Wisdom?,” <i>Henoch </i>24 (2002): 89–96.</p>

The most prominent contemporary proponent of an Enochic break with earlier Priestly traditions in Judaism is Gabriele Boccaccini, who lays out his thesis in <i>Beyond the Essene Hypothesis: The Parting of the Ways between Qumran and Enochic Judaism </i>(Grand Rapids, Mi.: Eerdmans, 1998).

I propose considering that the same is true of the “scientific” milieu. In fact, we have very little information about the greater culture in which the Jews in the land of Israel lived, either in the First or Second Temple periods. If we were dependent on the Hebrew Bible, virtually nothing, for the Hebrew Bible does not deal with scientific issues … All considered, however, it is probable that the ‘larger culture’ in which the Jews lived was basically Mesopotamian.” Stone <i>apud</i> Ben-Dov, “Scientific Writings in Aramaic and Hebrew at Qumran,” 400.</p>

Significant Deuteronomistic prohibitions of divination appear in Dt 18:10, 14; 1 Sam 15:23; 2 Kings 17:17. A remarkable scene in Ezekiel depicts the king of Babylon as employing a grab-bag of <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier388" href="#index_entry_magic_and_divination"/>divination techniques that help him decide to attack Jerusalem (21:26-28, where the root <i>qsm </i>appears four times). By contrast, Enoch presents contradictory positions on the study of the heavenly bodies, as an impetus to both obdedience and disobedience (1 En 2) and blasphemy (1 En 7-9) in the editorially complex <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier389" href="#index_entry_enoch_books_watchers"/><i>Book of Watchers</i>. Annette Reed explores this tension: Enoch promotes astronomy in 1 En 2 and the <i>Astronomical Book</i>, but it is condemned in the three accounts of the angels’ fall in 1 En 7-9, where transmitting knowledge of the workings of the stars and the course of the <a class="index_entry_reference" id="ier390" href="#index_entry_moon_lunar_models"/>moon, as well as the use of plants for healing, constituted a major part of the fallen angels’ transgression.

Ernest Wright</i> (ed. Frank Moore Cross, Werner Lemke, and Patrick D. Miller; Garden City N.Y.: Doubleday, 1976), 414-452. In applying the lists of revealed things in wisdom literature to the category of science, the important critique of Michael Fox, “Egyptian Onomastica and Biblical Wisdom,” <i>VT </i>36 (1986): 302-310 should be borne in mind. While it hardly invalidates Stone’s observations, it demands that more detailed arguments be provided for the social contexts in which the shift from ancient Near Eastern scribal “wisdom” to Hellenistic Jewish “science” took place—a demand that this essay and especially the contribution of Popović in this volume attempt to begin to answer.</p>

Crucially, Enoch is <i>shown </i>the “calculations” of the luminaries’ movements: <span xml:lang="hbo">ח]ש֯בון אחרן אחזית לה</span> “I was shown another calculation for it” in 4Q209 25 3 (corresponding to 1 En 74:1 or 78:10).

Because he reconstructs an unattested beginning to the sentence with the angel Uriel as the subject of an active form of <span xml:lang="hbo">חזי</span>, he is forced to translate the clear reading of the first person <i>aphel</i> passive asyndetically as “[and Uriel demonstrated to me] a further calculation by having shown it unto me that …” Milik, <i>The Books of Enoch,</i> 293. For a harsh verdict on Milik’s practices see the statement of Greenfield and Stone that “unless the reader has recourse to the diplomatic transcription, or better yet to the plates themselves, he will not always be sure as to where restoration begins and the actual text ends; indeed he cannot always be sure as to how much there actually is in the text since Milik’s readings are not always confirmed by the photographs, and by direct examination of the fragments.” See “The Books of Enoch and the Traditions of Enoch” <i>Numen </i>26 (1981): 90-91.
