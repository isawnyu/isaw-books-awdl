<h3>Phase 3: Abandonment, Collapse, and Deflation</h3>

<p onmouseover="document.getElementById('p3218anchor').style.display='';document.getElementById('p3218anchor_label').style.display='';" onmouseleave="document.getElementById('p3218anchor').style.display='none';document.getElementById('p3218anchor_label').style.display='none';" id="p3218" class="textindent0">Abandonment is a complex social process rather than a discrete event. The B2 abandonment process raises a plethora of unanswerable questions. Why did people leave? How did they organize their departure? To where did they migrate? Did they plan to return? Even when occupants abandon a structure, this building may experience ephemeral usage, and an abandoned building often influences conceptions and spatial usage in its immediate vicinity.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-3" href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup> It seems that it was quite common in ancient cities to find that certain building plots or parts of urban quarters went into disuse, while elsewhere in town urban life continued as before.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-4" href="#footnote-4">4</a></sup> B2 was located on a major road into Amheida, and it is likely that people passed by this house long after its abandonment.<a id="p3218anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p3218">↩</a><span id="p3218anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p3218">#p3218  </span></p>

In particular, room 1 has signs of an ephemeral burning episode on one of its walls (F4), which may suggest that squatters used this room for a short period of time. Furthermore, it is possible that individuals from this house relocated elsewhere at Amheida itself. The family may have revisited their earlier habitation over time, and their abandonment of B2 could have been gradual and long-term in scope rather than rapid and final. Although the vagaries of the abandonment process preclude definitive interpretations, we can say a good deal about Area 1 and hazard provisional suggestions for the usage of B2 during the latest occupational phase.<a id="p3219anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p3219">↩</a><span id="p3219anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p3219">#p3219  </span></p>

B2 may have witnessed some casual use, as indicated by the previously mentioned signs of burning on a wall (F4) above the floor surface in room 1. During this phase some windblown sand blew into rooms 1, 7, 8, and 9.<a id="p3220anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p3220">↩</a><span id="p3220anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p3220">#p3220  </span></p>

Rather, a dramatic deflation process occurred that was caused by constant wind erosion, evinced by the smooth and consistent deterioration evident in the east–west section of the northernmost portion of B2. This deflation clearly occurred after ceiling collapse, since the collapse in all of the rooms was flush with the preserved walls, having eroded at the same rate as the walls post-collapse. This erosion process was particularly evident in room 1, while room 3 was the most damaged by erosion.<a id="p3222anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p3222">↩</a><span id="p3222anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p3222">#p3222  </span></p>

<h2>House B2 and the Romano-Egyptian Domestic Spectrum</h2>

There are two other regions in Egypt worth exploring more deeply for comparisons across the Romano-Egyptian domestic spectrum: the Kharga Oasis and the Fayum.<a id="p3224anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p3224">↩</a><span id="p3224anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p3224">#p3224  </span></p>

Fayum houses generally lacked a clustered plan of access, central open areas, a pronounced horizontal component, and food preparation areas incorporated within the house. Houses at Karanis and Soknopaiou Nesos have a strong vertical component, while B2—and Dakhlan houses in general—tend to favor the horizontal component. Likewise, “kitchens” were almost never located within Roman Period houses in the Fayum, while B2 incorporated cooking areas into the house proper.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-6" href="#footnote-6">6</a></sup> Amheida House B1 also had some food preparation areas integrated within the main household core (rooms 4 and 8), as indicated by the presence of a hearth, instruments for grinding, and storage bins in these rooms.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-7" href="#footnote-7">7</a></sup><a id="p3225anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p3225">↩</a><span id="p3225anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p3225">#p3225  </span></p>

Khargan houses show a preference for a vertical component, which can be found commonly in the Fayum. Khargan houses also tend to have a more clustered room arrangement, which seems to have been typical of Dakhla. There are also close links between Amheida House B1 and the recently excavated houses at Douch.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-8" href="#footnote-8">8</a></sup> This Khargan evidence suggests that there were subtle regional variations on house plans. It seems reasonable to suggest that regions within close proximity to one another, or with strong social ties, influenced conceptions of house design.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-9" href="#footnote-9">9</a></sup><a id="p3226anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p3226">↩</a><span id="p3226anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p3226">#p3226  </span></p>

Some houses followed a more traditionally Egyptian layout, while others appear to have been more influenced by Roman Mediterranean traditions. Dakhla seems to have been shaped more by Roman Mediterranean norms than most housing regions currently known from Roman Egypt. The Fayum gives the impression a more traditionally Egyptian character, although a recent publication by Wilfong indicates that this interpretation could change if unpublished archives are consulted.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-10" href="#footnote-10">10</a></sup> Meanwhile, Kharga may be situated in between Dakhlan norms and the Fayum norms. These results suggest that houses should be examined within their regional spectrum and that it is important to build up comparisons between regions. They also indicate that we should no longer consider Karanis to be a standard Romano-Egyptian town, but rather a regional type of town.<a id="p3227anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p3227">↩</a><span id="p3227anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p3227">#p3227  </span></p>

We have excavated only a small aperture into this street, but we can make some conjectures on the basis of the evidence at this time. The S1 trench showed an area that was kept clean from most debris, but sand and other refuse would have built up over time, particularly on the south side of the street, opposite to the prevailing wind. The street was notably clean of rubbish disposal, suggesting that most refuse disposal may not have occured here but was placed in dumps not yet located at Amheida. The lack of waste (e.g., faunal remains) in the street may indicate that it was a civic mandate to keep this major conduit clear of such refuse. Moreover, it is the only major street so far identified at Amheida without significant intrusive constructions added.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-14" href="#footnote-14">14</a></sup><a id="p3231anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p3231">↩</a><span id="p3231anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p3231">#p3231  </span></p>

In his writing, doors and entrances represent a liminal space, since they transcend the separation between the inner “personal” world and outer “urban” world.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-15" href="#footnote-15">15</a></sup> Many authors have echoed this sentiment and found that the fundamental difference between Greek and Roman houses lies in the different entrance systems and visibility within the house. The Greek house created a private world by excluding passers-by, while the Roman house invited him in and put the occupants and their material life on display.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-16" href="#footnote-16">16</a></sup> Likewise, in many Roman cities the exteriors of the doorways into houses were lavished with decoration in recognition of the vital connection between the interior space of the house and the exterior space of the city.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-17" href="#footnote-17">17</a></sup><a id="p3233anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p3233">↩</a><span id="p3233anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p3233">#p3233  </span></p>

These dodged entrances may reflect different social perceptions of houses, but Egypt’s environment must be considered an important factor in design preferences, since the strong sand-laden winds necessitated a less-porous entrance. Numerous locations in Egypt had small adobe barriers constructed on either side of doorways to block sand, and the dodged entrance system indicates a similar pragmatic approach to the environment.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-20" href="#footnote-20">20</a></sup> Because of these environmental conditions, the entrance cannot reveal the openness of domestic spaces in Roman Egypt.

Room 9 initially opened directly onto the street but later was provided with stairs so the occupants could access the rising street surface. There are no signs that the walls of this room were ever decorated, although it is certainly possible. It appears that little effort was made to make this space impressive.

Room 7 is located east of room 9, and functioned as a multi-use area. The central position of this room suggests a Roman influence on the layout of the structure, and it may be interpreted as an <i>aithrion</i>. <i>Aithria</i> provided open and light spaces that would have contrasted sharply with the dark, closed confines of roofed rooms. <i>Aithria</i> were multi-functional and would have changed character throughout the day and the time of year, depending on shifting conditions such as light, temperature, and ephemeral activities. Individuals had to pass through room 7 repeatedly throughout the day in order to access the other rooms in B2, and women probably spent considerable time there for cooking activities. Because of its central location, size, and openness, it was probably the dominant gathering place in the house for social activities and interaction.<a id="p3236anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p3236">↩</a><span id="p3236anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p3236">#p3236  </span></p>

Courtyards and <i>aithria</i> often contained hearths or ovens, because such areas offered an open space through which the smoke could rise. These ovens would have drawn individuals to them for both the utility of preparing food and the warmth they would have provided during cold seasons. The floor space in front of the oven was patched and repaired, indicating intensive use of the oven feature. Given the amount of ash and residue found in room 5, it is notable that there was not more oven debris spread into the rest of the <i>aithrion</i>. Any ash produced by using the oven must have been cleaned and masked by the use of floor repairs. This cleanliness may have been motivated by the exposed and central location of room 7. Any visitor would have seen this room, and the ash would have been tracked easily throughout the house.<a id="p3237anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p3237">↩</a><span id="p3237anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p3237">#p3237  </span></p>

Light and sound would have traveled less well in the roofed side-rooms than in the courtyard, and they would have felt more private and isolated, even when open to public usage and viewing. Each of these side rooms, except for room 5, had a doorway closing it off from room 7. Individuals could create a sense of privacy by closing the doors to these rooms, which would have removed them from the activity and noise of the <i>aithrion</i>.<a id="p3238anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p3238">↩</a><span id="p3238anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p3238">#p3238  </span></p>

Some remains of emmer wheat were found in the room, likely due to its close proximity to room 7 and the bread oven.

We found no significant portable objects on the staircase, but there were botanical remains on the hallway floor of room 8. It is possible that foods were stored in the vicinity or upon the roof, which was accessed from this staircase. Indeed, it is likely that the roof was used for cereal drying and grain cleaning, since it was an open, bright space, ideal for such tasks. Rooftops have been used throughout Egyptian history as an additional work, storage, and sleeping area. A portion of the ceramics assemblage from room 6 was found within roof collapse and may have originated from this roof, which corroborates conjectures that the roof was used for storage and work.<a id="p3252anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p3252">↩</a><span id="p3252anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p3252">#p3252  </span></p>

Such lack of material is singular for B2 and suggests that objects may have been removed from these rooms at the time of abandonment. What objects would have been stored here that the inhabitants would want to take with them? In order to gain some perspective on what such storerooms often contained, I draw upon a papyrus from <i>c.</i> 200 CE, slightly earlier than the proposed occupation of this structure. This papyrus contains the following inventory of household goods:<a id="p3254anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p3254">↩</a><span id="p3254anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p3254">#p3254  </span></p>

Although rooms 4 and 10 contained some organic remains, these rooms were largely cleared before the house was abandoned, much like the storage jars in room 6. This clearance indicates that the majority of the items stored in those rooms were of some economic or emotional value to the inhabitants, or that other people removed them post-abandonment because of their economic value. Such objects would correspond with the range of objects listed in the above inventory. It is plausible that most food items in B2 would have been kept in room 11 and the storage jars located in room 6 because these ground floor storage areas were more easily accessible for daily needs than the under stairs storage areas.<a id="p3255anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p3255">↩</a><span id="p3255anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p3255">#p3255  </span></p>

The people living in the house or using these goods had knowledge of the contents, whereas visitors to B2 would not have a clear conception of the types and quantities of goods that the inhabitants had in their possession. Room 11 was in a more visible area of the house. There were probably differentiations between the types of goods stored in these discrete locales of rooms 11, 4, 10, and under the floor of room 6. The patterns of repeated usage and differentiated nature of storage spaces must have been even more obvious to their users than to us, their excavators, in the daily practices of individuals.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-37" href="#footnote-37">37</a></sup><a id="p3256anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p3256">↩</a><span id="p3256anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p3256">#p3256  </span></p>

Children could access these storage areas through trap doors and could maneuver about the confined spaces more effortlessly than adults. The fully-grown adults in B2 may not have been able to explore the under stairs storage areas thoroughly. On the other hand, the below floor (room 6) and room 11 storage areas were readily accessible to all ages and genders. Outside of the house, visitors to the residence may have known about some of these spaces, as well as their number and location. For example, storage areas are common below stairs, so visitors could assume their existence. People may have wondered if their neighbors had a large supply of goods stored up or if their storage facilities were empty.

Early on during our excavations we presumed that B2 might have had a strong connection to C2, due to the proximity of the two and the lack of division walls found east of B2. Subsequent excavations revealed that Courtyard C2 belonged to House B9. In either case, the presence of this external courtyard enabled activities such as off-loading and on-loading goods, provisioning animals, and other domestic activities that the ostraka from Area 1 mention. A bread oven, exposed in the southwest corner, underscores the multi-use nature of this space.<a id="p3259anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p3259">↩</a><span id="p3259anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p3259">#p3259  </span></p>

These material remains included an ostrakon dating to the third century CE, a miniature lamp, a clay figurine head, loom weights, and several complete vessels. The miniature ceramics and clay figurine head may have been toys, which would suggest the presence of children in the vicinity.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-40" href="#footnote-40">40</a></sup> Alternatively, these objects could be associated with magic or cultic activities. The overall image of the courtyard acquires a multifaceted dimension, since it seems to have been used as a locale for stabling animals, producing food, and possibly even child-play. It would have been a vibrant place with so many activities possible and probably overlapping.<a id="p3260anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p3260">↩</a><span id="p3260anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p3260">#p3260  </span></p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

Food preparation (rooms 5, 7) and storage areas (rooms 4, 6, 10, 11) are particularly evident within this structure. There are also more subtle spatial distinctions, such as the strong clustering of ostraka, amulets, statues, and objects of adornment in the eastern rooms of the structure (rooms 1–3, 7), and areas focused upon craft production (rooms 3, 6). Based upon these data, I suggest that rooms 1–3 and room 6 could have been used for sleeping in addition to other activities. This usage was dependent upon how these rooms were being used, the weather, who occupied the house at that time, and how many people were present. During certain times of the year, the roof space and room 7 might have offered an attractive escape from the heat. Conversely, rooms close to ovens (rooms 1 and 6) may have been preferred during cold winter months. It is important to remember that furniture, such as beds, was expensive, and most households probably did not have a bed for each individual who lived and slept in the house.<a id="p3261anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p3261">↩</a><span id="p3261anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p3261">#p3261  </span></p>

Excavations in the two primary rooms used for food production in B2 (rooms 5 and 7) revealed very different states of cleanliness. The practical activity of cleaning a room reveals that room 7 merited greater social consideration than room 5. This result might be expected because room 7 was a central room that would have been visible to all guests and household members. This cleanliness disparity also may reveal attitudes towards the gendered importance of cleanliness; spaces used almost exclusively by women did not warrant the additional time it would take to clean them thoroughly. If this is true, then it could be imagined that women chose to prioritize their time over the cleanliness of rooms accessed infrequently by others, such as room 5 and (to a lesser degree) room 3.<a id="p3262anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p3262">↩</a><span id="p3262anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p3262">#p3262  </span></p>

Papyrological data suggests that 25.3 per cent of households were multiple family households consisting of two brothers or sisters and their spouses, or a married couple with married children who remained in the parental home. These multiple family households had a mean of 10.36 people in them within towns.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-45" href="#footnote-45">45</a></sup> Van Minnen has argued that 4.5 people would share a dwelling with four to five rooms, which entails that the B2 household, which has a slightly larger number of rooms, might be somewhere in the order of 9 people.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-46" href="#footnote-46">46</a></sup> Papyrological data for Philadelphia indicate that 9 people per house might be likely.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-47" href="#footnote-47">47</a></sup><a id="p3266anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p3266">↩</a><span id="p3266anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p3266">#p3266  </span></p>

From a general Roman perspective, however, B2 appears to be quite well-off.

During the course of excavating B2, it was hypothesized that these cultural signatures may be linked to status.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-49" href="#footnote-49">49</a></sup> The ambiguous cultural signatures found in B2 indicate a clear distinction between B1 and B2, which may be linked to economic stratum.

The C2A excavations reveal that this courtyard was used for stabling animals, and at least one item mentioned as a transport good in the texts (doum fruit) was found there. The ostraka also mention linen-weavers, and a tailor or a teamster, which suggests laborers, regardless of their degree of specialization.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-50" href="#footnote-50">50</a></sup><a id="p3269anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p3269">↩</a><span id="p3269anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p3269">#p3269  </span></p>

These data justify a link between laborers and B2’s occupants. It is notable that the B2 ceramics are of a consistently lower quality than those from Amheida House B1, and there are many utilitarian artifacts that point towards manual labor.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-51" href="#footnote-51">51</a></sup><a id="p3270anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p3270">↩</a><span id="p3270anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p3270">#p3270  </span></p>

The qualities of personal adornment indicate that the inhabitants were able to amplify their physical appearance with goods that imitated more elite <i>au courant </i>jewelry. In conjunction with particular forms of clothing or hairstyles, personal adornment attests to different identities within communities, regardless of whether these differences were formed on the basis of gender, status, or age. Material identity signatures, such as jewelry, generated assumptions about the social group(s) in which an individual would fit. Possessing adornment bestowed prestige upon the possessor because of the economic, historical, and social value of the object.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-52" href="#footnote-52">52</a></sup> Moreover, these objects may have served as embodiments of family and domestic history, setting the family apart from others or drawing individuals or the family into an understood group.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-53" href="#footnote-53">53</a></sup><a id="p3271anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p3271">↩</a><span id="p3271anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p3271">#p3271  </span></p>

Within this house, it is likely that women primarily used room 5. These individuals used room 5 in a routine manner rather than actively considering and constructing how others might view it.

Also, it is probable that women commonly used room 3, since the artifact assemblage contains evidence of cloth production. This room shows a less singular function than room 5, and men also may have used room 3 for various activities, including linen weaving.

With respect to physical space within B2, children probably accessed the storage rooms (rooms 4 and 10) frequently, since these rooms were too small to comfortably admit adults into their confines. The small stature of children would enable them to maneuver within these spaces more easily and they doubtless contributed to household tasks by accessing these spaces. Outside of the house, we find evidence that women and men used the exterior courtyard, as evinced by the presence of a bread oven, a figurine, miniature clay lamp, and coprolites from animals used for transportation. Children almost certainly assisted in these tasks, which would have served an important role for training them in future obligations and expectations as well as assisting with the economic functioning of the household.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-69" href="#footnote-69">69</a></sup><a id="p3280anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p3280">↩</a><span id="p3280anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p3280">#p3280  </span></p>

Equally, adherence to traditional plant species and technologies during phases of innovation and change can create a strong impact. The consequences of innovations and conservativism varied with the scales of cultivation and the scheduling of activities in the agricultural cycle. Food production changed in later Egyptian history with the introduction of durum and bread wheat, so much so that emmer wheat was nearly eradicated from the diet. Cotton, which was introduced to the oases in the Roman period, probably had a strong economic impact on the region. The introduction of new products changed labor requirements, the agricultural cycle, food and cloth preparation, dress, and social feasting practices. The adherence to conventional food and textile practices within this house is notable and suggests that the women resisted changing from traditional foodways and textile production.<a id="p3287anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p3287">↩</a><span id="p3287anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p3287">#p3287  </span></p>

These findings suggest future lines of inquiry into the associations between specific ethnic heritages, economic level, architectural style, and perhaps even neighborhood. Overt public expressions of status and ethnicity probably advertised the individuals who were in control of decisions and resources. The absence of overtly visually expressive objects suggests that this family was not among the most significant politically and socially at Amheida.

House B2 enables us to explore micro-level relationships within this household, which was positioned in a distinct region within Rome’s Egyptian province. This focused study of one household promotes a specified understanding of Rome’s impact upon a particular local area. Such microhistories do not necessarily correlate with the broad picture achieved through macroscale explorations. Although B2 may or may not be representative of a local “norm,” an exploration of the results helps us to avoid descriptive interpretive models, such as Romanization. In particular, these results contribute to new ways of viewing identity, social change, cultural interplay and daily life in Egypt under Roman rule.<a id="p3291anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p3291">↩</a><span id="p3291anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p3291">#p3291  </span></p>

We can explore identity from two different perspectives: the macroscale and the microscale. On the macroscale level of the Roman Empire, formal associations and categories define identities. On the microscale of the household or the individual, the single subjective agent experiences many fluctuating facets of identity throughout the life span.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-82" href="#footnote-82">82</a></sup> Macroscale identities are generally stable and long-lasting, while microscale identities are more fluid and dependent upon immediate social contexts.<a id="p3292anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p3292">↩</a><span id="p3292anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p3292">#p3292  </span></p>

In particular, the Roman world enables us to explore the subtle layering of identities in the wake of conquest and consolidation. Recent studies of provincial identities suggest that different cultural markers cannot be assumed to be orchestrated and harmonious expressions of a single absolute of “cultural identity.”<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-83" href="#footnote-83">83</a></sup> Material culture has its own grammar that does not always shadow political and linguistic changes. Cultural goods can be transported and appropriated with extraordinary ease and frequency into different contexts. In the course of this transport, the cultural attributes of material goods often become separated from their original milieu and imported objects become endowed with local meaning. Moreover we find that Roman imperial categories and preconceptions about various provincial peoples under its rule do not necessarily correspond with the microscale realities in these same provinces.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-84" href="#footnote-84">84</a></sup><a id="p3293anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p3293">↩</a><span id="p3293anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p3293">#p3293  </span></p>

In essense, globalization spreads a similar material culture across the world, but research has shown that local areas use these goods in divergent ways.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-85" href="#footnote-85">85</a></sup> These contemporary studies suggest that shared goods do not necessarily entail that a given group that uses these same goods is similar to any other group(s) that also appropriated them. Local areas may use equivalent goods in different ways and attribute different meanings to the same type of object. The present study of House B2 indicates the ways in which one household made use of material culture in a manner that would have influenced their conceptions of self and their placement within the Roman world.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-86" href="#footnote-86">86</a></sup><a id="p3294anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p3294">↩</a><span id="p3294anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p3294">#p3294  </span></p>

Ancient Mediterranean cultures are highly stratified, and the traces of each episode of conquest and colonization often influenced subsequent interactions for many centuries. Egypt, in particular, had a complicated layering of foreign rule, including Assyrian, Persian, Greek, and finally Roman rule. These progressive waves of conquest did not erode with each new conquest, but compounded, shifted, and recombined over time.<a id="p3295anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p3295">↩</a><span id="p3295anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p3295">#p3295  </span></p>

As a consequence of Egypt’s history as a locale for rebellion, Rome tried to stave off immigration to Egypt from elsewhere within the Roman Empire.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-87" href="#footnote-87">87</a></sup> This policy affected Egyptian demographics. Relatively few Romans migrated to Egypt during Roman rule, unlike the many thousands of Greeks who were encouraged to immigrate to Egypt under Ptolemaic rule.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-88" href="#footnote-88">88</a></sup> This demographic impact was differentiated between cities and rural areas, particularly in the early phases of Roman rule. Despite the prohibitions against immigration, migrations and other demographic changes took place, which complicated the already multi-faceted identities that built up during post-Pharaonic Egypt. Although these Roman legal categories of “Greek” and “Egyptian” came to an end prior to the occupation of B2, we cannot expect that individuals experienced these licit changes instantaneously. Scholars often presume that ethnic affinities dispersed by the late Roman Period in Egypt, but few have employed a material-based approach to justify this assumption.<a id="p3296anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p3296">↩</a><span id="p3296anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p3296">#p3296  </span></p>

Migration can be multidirectional.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-89" href="#footnote-89">89</a></sup> Demographic movements, trade, and the exchange of ideas took place throughout the empire as well as within Egypt itself. Objects deriving from Egyptian, Greek, or Roman traditions, as well as any combination between these and other influences, became available on a much broader scale than they were prior to the Roman conquest. In addition to these far-reaching exchanges were small-scale movements within Egypt itself. Locals appear to have migrated from one region of Egypt to another with great frequency, as evinced by changing population densities in Egypt’s Western Desert.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-90" href="#footnote-90">90</a></sup><a id="p3297anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p3297">↩</a><span id="p3297anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p3297">#p3297  </span></p>

The Ptolemaic bureaucratic and political system disadvantaged the Egyptian ethnic category. This bias encouraged Egyptians to manipulate their ethnic identity and many Egyptian individuals acquired the Greek language and <i>mores </i>in order to be classified as “Greek.” Although the term “Greek” might denote someone totally or partially of immigrant Greek descent, there also existed “Greek” individuals who achieved this ethnic designation on the basis of their occupation and tax status. This maneuvering worked well under Ptolemaic rule, but the system imposed under Roman rule severely restricted membership in the “Greek” group. Romans and citizens of the few Greek cities (such as Alexandria) held the highest status under Roman rule, while the rest of the population were categorized as “Egyptians.” These Egyptians, in turn, were subdivided into villagers and metropolitans, with the metropolitans representing the higher status.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-91" href="#footnote-91">91</a></sup><a id="p3300anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p3300">↩</a><span id="p3300anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p3300">#p3300  </span></p>

Unfortunately, the term Romanization often serves as descriptive shorthand for complicated processes, because it glosses over the multifaceted ways in which ordinary people experienced the Roman Empire. For example, individuals could unintentionally or indirectly take on Roman signatures.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-105" href="#footnote-105">105</a></sup> Moreover, the term does not explore the mechanisms or agents involved in cultural change. As a result, the concept does little to explain the complicated processes that took place on the ground, enacted by ordinary people. Romanization also has experienced a long history of study, which resulted in numerous contrasting interpretations.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-106" href="#footnote-106">106</a></sup> Recently, scholars have questioned the value of the concept out of concerns that the term itself is unclear and because it encourages simplified analyses of multifaceted social processes.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-107" href="#footnote-107">107</a></sup><a id="p3308anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p3308">↩</a><span id="p3308anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p3308">#p3308  </span></p>

For example, it is completely impossible to separate the process of Romanization from Hellenization (the adoption of Greek culture). These two cultures are interdependent in Imperial Rome, and in some cases Romanization and Hellenization are synonymous. At its most basic level, Hellenization can be described as a stylistic and cultural influence, while Romanization served as a political overlay.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-108" href="#footnote-108">108</a></sup> In other words, the term “Roman” was a juridical category that was defined by citizenship, by membership of the <i>populus Romanus</i>, or by other types of relationships to Roman <i>imperium</i>. By contrast, the term “Hellenic” served as a cultural category for describing people with a shared language and culture in a way that peoples of the Roman Empire never experienced.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-109" href="#footnote-109">109</a></sup> Bowersock’s discussion of Hellenism as a cultural expression that in no way threatened other cultures and religions gives us fertile ground for thinking through the multiplex social influences we have identified in the Roman Empire.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-110" href="#footnote-110">110</a></sup><a id="p3309anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p3309">↩</a><span id="p3309anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p3309">#p3309  </span></p>

Domestic scenarios account for how everyday life conveys cultural memory through commonplace actions and behaviors. Investigations into Roman social memory point to the household as the pivotal point of tradition transmision through the generations. Families pass along memories through names, genealogy, religious rites, and quotidian activities, such as preparing food and learning the family trade.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-113" href="#footnote-113">113</a></sup> Memory is central to the construction of familial identity, because parents often required their children to step into the roles of their ancestors in everyday activities. Children served as key actors in the process of infusing ancestral commemoration with memories and conveying this infusion on an everyday basis.

These goods shaped the ways in which people acted out who they were and what they intended as their relationships with others, even unconsciously expressing and recognizing affinities to groups. Importantly, the new materiality of the Roman Period provided, if not the finished product, then at least the tools required for fashioning new expressions of individual, household, and village identities. A significant component of these changes was the widening variety of new objects in daily life that could be employed for many different purposes.

What is enormously difficult to assess is whether this result entails that the inhabitants had multiple identities (whether in conflict or in harmony), or that the household absorbed new practices into a single cohesive identity. In other words, did taking on Roman material culture make this family feel specifically Roman, or associated with a broader Mediterranean cultural <i>koine</i>? Alternatively, this household may not have considered these goods to be cultural interlopers. It is impossible to resolve such questions at this time, but future research on similar households may enable us to reexamine these questions more satisfactorily in the future.<a id="p3314anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p3314">↩</a><span id="p3314anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p3314">#p3314  </span></p>

Hopefully this holistic exploration of Amheida House B2 contributes a beneficial step towards this eventual goal.<a id="p3317anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p3317">↩</a><span id="p3317anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p3317">#p3317  </span></p>

Rubbish preservation is typically achieved through burial in “fill” layers, from building construction, or the digging of waste pits. In very late urban contexts, waste sometimes accumulated in a haphazard way, in public and private spaces, comparable to trash accumulation in prehistoric and medieval settlements. Because of the inadvertent way it accumulates, rubbish often reflects everyday life better than abandonment levels. Sometimes these deposits can be linked to specific activity areas, which can provide substantial information about spatial organization within a community, such as consumption patterns. These deposits were probably heavily sorted for re-usable items, making functional identification complex (Lavan, Swift and Putzeys 2007:7).</p><p class="footnote" id="footnote-15"><sup><a href="#footnote-reference-15">15</a></sup> Simmel 1997:67.</p><p class="footnote" id="footnote-16"><sup><a href="#footnote-reference-16">16</a></sup> Jameson 1990:9, Wallace-Hadrill 1988.</p><p class="footnote" id="footnote-17"><sup><a href="#footnote-reference-17">17</a></sup> Hales 2003:97-106.</p><p class="footnote" id="footnote-18"><sup><a href="#footnote-reference-18">18</a></sup> Husselman 1979:40.</p><p class="footnote" id="footnote-19"><sup><a href="#footnote-reference-19">19</a></sup> Alston 2002:82.</p><p class="footnote" id="footnote-20"><sup><a href="#footnote-reference-20">20</a></sup> On adobe barriers, see Hope, Kaper, Bowen and Patten 1989, Davoli 1998:4, Boozer 2015.</p><p class="footnote" id="footnote-21"><sup><a href="#footnote-reference-21">21</a></sup> Thanheiser, this volume.</p><p class="footnote" id="footnote-22"><sup><a href="#footnote-reference-22">22</a></sup> Thanheiser, this volume.</p><p class="footnote" id="footnote-23"><sup><a href="#footnote-reference-23">23</a></sup> Ruffini, this volume.</p><p class="footnote" id="footnote-24"><sup><a href="#footnote-reference-24">24</a></sup> Bagnall and Ruffini 2012, Ast and Davoli 2013.</p><p class="footnote" id="footnote-25"><sup><a href="#footnote-reference-25">25</a></sup> Inv. 3534, Inv. 3741, Inv. 3733.</p><p class="footnote" id="footnote-26"><sup><a href="#footnote-reference-26">26</a></sup> Inv. 3405+3408 = O.Trim. 1.20 and Inv. 3406 = O.Trim. 1.21 (Ruffini, this volume).</p><p class="footnote" id="footnote-27"><sup><a href="#footnote-reference-27">27</a></sup> Robins 1993:95, Bowen, 2001:24.</p><p class="footnote" id="footnote-28"><sup><a href="#footnote-reference-28">28</a></sup> See www.Amheida.org for reports on the ongoing excavations in C2.</p><p class="footnote" id="footnote-29"><sup><a href="#footnote-reference-29">29</a></sup> This type of hearth was also found in House B1 at Amheida.</p><p class="footnote" id="footnote-30"><sup><a href="#footnote-reference-30">30</a></sup> This type of hearth is common; for example see Bayoumi and Aravecchia’s excavations at Ain el Gedida.

An arrangement similar to B2 was found at House 2 at Kellis, which has a corridor leading to stairs and an under-stairs cupboard. The later addition of a kitchen was added in close proximity to the under-stairs cupboard and stairs (Hope 1988:169). Understairs areas were commonly associated with women, especially when menstruating (Wilfong 2002:51, 77), but this understairs area from B2 is too small to enable women to use it in that fashion.</p><p class="footnote" id="footnote-35"><sup><a href="#footnote-reference-35">35</a></sup> Stud Pal.

For my care of the goods indoors and my management would look rather ridiculous…if you did not see that something is gathered in from outside.” “And my ingathering would look ridiculous,” I countered, “if there were not someone to keep what is gathered in.” (Xenophon Oikonomikos VII.37-41). In this Greek context, men were viewed as suppliers and women as users of storage spaces. It is unclear if this concept was current in Roman Egypt.</p><p class="footnote" id="footnote-40"><sup><a href="#footnote-reference-40">40</a></sup> The category of “toy” is problematic. The functional classification of an object as a purpose-built toy is a complicated undertaking (Lillehammer 1989, Egan 1996). Moreover, children often play with the everyday objects that surround them (Sofaer Derevenski 1994). Even so, it is worthwhile suggesting the possibility since we know that children used these miniatures in similar contexts. For example Karanis had several examples of probable toys, including a wooden horse on wheels (Accession Number 0000.00.3312), a rag doll (Accession number 0000.01.0113), and a miniature comb (Accession Number 0000.00.3162).
