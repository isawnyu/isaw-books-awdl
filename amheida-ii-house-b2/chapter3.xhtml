B1 is a large, lavishly decorated house close in proximity to what appears to be the urban core of Amheida. The excavations at B1 revealed a great deal about the identity of the inhabitants and their preference for Greek and Roman material and visual culture.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup> The surface remains in Area 1 suggested to us that we could find less wealthy families in this area of the site and would be able to determine material differences between these people and those who lived in Area 2. Upon excavation, it became clear that there were very different states of preservation between B1 and B2. The walls of B1 were preserved to a greater height than those of B2, which makes it easier to reconstruct the architecture of B1. On the other hand, we found that soft organics were preserved better in B2 than in B1 and that there appeared to be a higher density of occupational debris in B2 than in B1.<a id="p121anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p121">↩</a><span id="p121anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p121">#p121  </span></p>

Area 1.1 had eroded to such a degree that only the foundations were visible. Survey continues to define this area of the site and all of the survey data is collected in CAD.

We expanded our excavation to areas external to House B2 in 2007 in order to compare the stratigraphies of these areas with those inside the structure. We also wanted to determine activities that took place around the house in order to inform interpretations of interior activities. Our first exterior excavation took place in the street just north of the house. We laid out a 6.10 x 2 m east–west oriented trench in this area, aligning it against the north wall of B2. In this manner we also exposed the exterior face of the structure’s north wall. Likewise, we explored the exterior courtyard behind B2. This exterior courtyard initially appeared to be a large L-shaped open space (20 x 21 m) south and east of B2.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-6" href="#footnote-6">6</a></sup> We laid out a north–south oriented 10 x 2 meter trench against the south wall of House B2 and the west wall of Couryard C2. This trench was later expanded by an additional 1.5 x 1.5 meters to the east, against the south wall of Courtyard C2, in order to allow us to expose some features more fully.

<h2>Excavation Strategy and Theoretical Perspectives</h2>

I pursued this goal, as chapter 1 explains, because past approaches to domestic contexts in Roman Egypt have revealed very little about how individual households functioned in different socio-economic groups, ethnic groups, or regions. A contextual approach to material culture from domestic contexts will help fill this lacuna and will enable scholars of Roman Egypt to engage with other Romanists, Egyptologists, and other social theorists through new research questions that extend beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries.<a id="p125anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p125">↩</a><span id="p125anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p125">#p125  </span></p>

Although this approach dominated my own research initiatives, I recognize that it is important to remain cognizant of the diverse range of methods that archaeologists have used in order to comprehend different categories of data. For example, archaeologists have typically analyzed categories of data on the basis of material types (e.g., ceramics, texts, or depositional information) and these close analyses are of great benefit to specialists as well as individuals who wish to delve deeper into specific research questions.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-7" href="#footnote-7">7</a></sup> This volume uses both thematic and material category modes of analyzing archaeological data in order to view objects from a variety of perspectives and to capture a broad range of relational significance.

<h2>Excavation Methods</h2>

These methods were employed from 2004 at Amheida and also have been employed at the site of Ain el-Gedida.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-8" href="#footnote-8">8</a></sup> MoLA and the Harris Matrix offer valuable methods for understanding a complex archaeological site because they view the site as a palimpsest of discrete events that come about through either deposition or removal. These methods enable us to understand the sequential development of a site with maximum control over stratigraphy while simultaneously enabling us to view the archaeological record as a dynamic, creative process enacted by individuals.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-9" href="#footnote-9">9</a></sup><a id="p127anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p127">↩</a><span id="p127anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p127">#p127  </span></p>

In other words, the MoLA system helps us to understand activities and patterns that theoretically occurred within a single moment in time. Single context recording was developed as a means to avoid reliance on multiple-feature or composite plans (i.e., plans that record all or phased features respectively, on the same drawing). Single context recording recognizes that physical and stratigraphic relationships are not conflated but distinct.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-10" href="#footnote-10">10</a></sup> This method considers the stratigraphic sequence to be the primary consideration in the excavation and recording of sites. The basis of this approach is to divide up the site into discrete units or contexts that are excavated and recorded according to their stratigraphic position. In the words of Westman: “Any single action, whether it leaves a positive or negative record within the sequence, is known as a ‘context’.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-11" href="#footnote-11">11</a></sup>” One of the crucial assumptions of single-context recording is that each unit represents a single action or event such that its spatial limits also define temporal limits.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-12" href="#footnote-12">12</a></sup> An action, in this sense, denotes activities such as repaving a floor, repairing a wall, or even more ephemeral practices such as baking bread in an oven.<a id="p128anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p128">↩</a><span id="p128anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p128">#p128  </span></p>

Following the Harris Matrix, we used deposition stratigraphic units (DSUs) to build up the stratigraphic history of the house through comparing the stratigraphy of rooms. We did the same for the street (S1) and the courtyard (C2) and then compared these stratigraphies with those in House B2 in order to understand phasing. The conceptual foundation of the Harris Matrix is that any stratigraphic unit can have only three possible kinds of direct relationship to another: none, earlier/later than, or equivalent to.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-13" href="#footnote-13">13</a></sup> In practice, contexts may have indirect relationships with other contexts, as well as more direct relationships. The nature of this indirect relationship cannot be determined stratigraphically but must be discovered by other means, which involve grouping (or phasing) the matrix into broad divisions, which are approximately contemporary. Ideally, we can conduct grouping through major horizon breaks in the sequence and/or independent dating through finds association, such as datable objects (e.g. texts and coins). Essentially, the notion of grouping relies on permutations in the matrix, which occur in all multi-linear sequences.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-14" href="#footnote-14">14</a></sup><a id="p129anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p129">↩</a><span id="p129anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p129">#p129  </span></p>

A supervisor controlled all work in the area, while an assistant supervisor and several local workmen were allotted a room. The area supervisor, with help from assistants, was in charge of the area documentation. Whenever it was advantageous to attain greater control over the vertical component of the excavation, we subdivided DSUs into arbitrary DSUs. For example, in situations in which we found windblown sand to a significant depth, we wanted to distinguish surface sand from the lower layers, although the matrix itself was identical. Whenever it was critical to attain greater control over the horizontal component of the excavation, we gridded the space and applied different DSU numbers to different portions of the grid. For example, some of the floor layers that we reached contained high densities of ceramics that were easier for the ceramicist to analyze if we gridded the floor levels, although from a depositional standpoint the units appeared to be identical.<a id="p130anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p130">↩</a><span id="p130anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p130">#p130  </span></p>

We made use of each of these recording techniques for each context. We took starting and ending elevations of each context and object with an automatic level, while we made use of an EDM theodolite (Total Station) for some of the small finds and all of the architectural features.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-15" href="#footnote-15">15</a></sup> We drew sections in situations that would clarify the depositional history of the structure along two different axes across the house (north–south and east–west).<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-16" href="#footnote-16">16</a></sup> We drew plan views of all of the walls in structure B2 in order to capture details of brick laying patterns. These details and other exposed features were added to the digital CAD plan of the site.<a id="p131anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p131">↩</a><span id="p131anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p131">#p131  </span></p>

We used 1:20 scale drawings for each context to show a greater level of detail than our day drawings. Likewise, all archaeologists completed day notes forms, which recorded in narrative form the events, finds and decisions of the day. We used pro-formas to describe each DSU and FSU, which we entered into the relational project database upon completion of these units.<a id="p132anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p132">↩</a><span id="p132anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p132">#p132  </span></p>

We treated all objects that were discovered and recognized as objects during excavation in the same manner. When an object was found, we gave it a unique number to identify it along with a brief description, recorded the exact find spot with respect to the x, y, and z axes, photographed it, and included the object on a context plan. In other words, we precisely located and documented all of the small finds in three-dimensional space within each context. These data enable us to determine the immediate environment from which the objects derived. We took soil samples of each sealed floor context and other sealed remains rich in organic materials for archaeobotanical analysis. These samples were also located within three-dimensional space and noted on plans.<a id="p133anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p133">↩</a><span id="p133anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p133">#p133  </span></p>

Some of our objects were found in the screens, and therefore these objects can be identified by context but not by precise location in three-dimensional space. It was not feasible or meaningful to screen windblown sand above these levels.<a id="p134anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p134">↩</a><span id="p134anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p134">#p134  </span></p>

For other artifact classes, however, we have avoided repetition by the illustration of types that recur with great frequency, as is notable in the case of the ceramics. In other instances, some of the artifacts were too poorly preserved to be identified properly or illustrated by line drawing, but we have made an attempt to describe and photograph each of these artifacts in our catalogue in hopes that they will be of use when compared to remains from other sites.

These area designations derive from the New York University Project, but I project them backward for the sake of clarity. In Area 2, the DOP cleared the upper portion of two walls from a structure in an area of the site with a concentration of vaulted and painted structures. In so doing they found paintings with Greek mythological figures. The DOP did a preliminary study of these figures and then backfilled them until formal excavations could commence (Leahy 1980, Mills 1980).
