We dedicated three additional seasons to finds processing (2008–2010). The majority of the material presented in this volume was excavated in February of 2005 and 2006, and we conducted additional research in the vicinity of B2 in February of 2007. Finds processing took place during excavations and continued as study seasons during January–February 2008, 2009, and 2010 (Figure 4.1).<a id="p149anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p149">↩</a><span id="p149anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p149">#p149  </span></p>

Excavation proceeded by room since the walls of the rooms were visible from the surface. We employed the single context system, as outlined in the previous chapter, in our excavations. We excavated these rooms simultaneously, with one supervisor managing each room. The supervision of room 2 changed during the course of our excavations, leading to a re-evaluation of the contexts during excavation and during post-excavation. This re-evaluation is visible in the analysis of the stratigraphy in room 2. At the very end of the 2005 field season we began excavating room 4, removing only a small amount of windblown sand. We continued the room 4 excavations in 2006.<a id="p150anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p150">↩</a><span id="p150anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p150">#p150  </span></p>

As with the easternmost rooms, the walls were visible from the surface so we proceeded by room and employed single context excavation. We began new excavations in rooms 5 and 6. One supervisor directed excavations in rooms 4 and 5, while another managed room 6. We continued with rooms 7 and 8 and 11 with one supervisor overseeing this work. Rooms 9 and 10 were excavated last, and were supervised by one individual.<a id="p151anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p151">↩</a><span id="p151anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p151">#p151  </span></p>

In 2004, Eugene Ball conducted preliminary research in this area but did not excavate. Rather, his team conducted surface scraping on structure 1.1 and in Street S1 in front of structure 1.1 in order to gain a sense of the time horizon or sequence of occupations in this vicinity of the site. In 2007, we chose to excavate a trench in Street S1 immediately in front of B2 in order to determine the relationship between the structure and the street as well as to clarify phasing in B2. Likewise, we excavated a trench (C2A) in Courtyard C2 in order to clarify phasing in B2, the function of this external courtyard, and the relationship between B2 and the courtyard.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup><a id="p152anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p152">↩</a><span id="p152anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p152">#p152  </span></p>

The following pages delineate the excavation of this structure in a manner that is intended to closely reflect the excavation process. I begin with a discussion of what was visible from the surface and then move through the excavation of each layer as we encountered it, followed by a description of the visible architectural elements. I summarize the excavation results for each room and then review the phasing for each area from earliest to latest phases: B2, the street north of B2 (S1), and the courtyard south of B2 (C2). SUQ quantities, single context plans, additional photographs and other information for each DSU can be found by consulting the open-access database.<a id="p153anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p153">↩</a><span id="p153anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p153">#p153  </span></p>

In rooms 1, 2, 3, and 6 the clean foundation sand was reached, approximately 7–10 cm below the lowest preserved floors. A 1.75 m deep test trench was dug in room 2 in order to determine if there was any prior occupation in this area of the site. No evidence of older buildings was found here, and the matrixes were found to be largely sterile. This situation is similar to that found at Kellis, where Houses 1 and 2 in Area A were built directly upon the clay surface of the site or upon deliberately laid earth deposits with no traces of earlier occupation.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-3" href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup><a id="p156anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p156">↩</a><span id="p156anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p156">#p156  </span></p>

It consisted of clean windblown sand covered with a dense lens of pottery sherds. Within the sandy matrix there were moderate to high densities of ceramics, clinker (sometimes identified as slag on forms and in the database), and plaster in addition to low densities of wood, bone, and glass. As the artifact densities lessened we changed DSUs, because the lower levels of windblown sand were less contaminated than the upper levels of windblown sand. We also suspected that lower levels of windblown sand belonged to a phase of building collapse and deflation and wished to capture this phase in more detail.<a id="p159anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p159">↩</a><span id="p159anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p159">#p159  </span></p>

The DSU change was done because we wanted to distinguish objects that may have derived from roof and ceiling collapse, including objects that may have been stored originally on the roof. There were low densities of artifacts, including ceramics, glass, plaster, bone, and clinker. This DSU was mostly confined to the southeast corner of room 1, while ceiling and wall collapse (DSU 4) occupied the rest of the room. The erosion of this stratigraphic unit may represent a deflationary process, and therefore the objects are more likely than the surface objects to have belonged to B2 itself and may have derived from the roof.<a id="p160anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p160">↩</a><span id="p160anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p160">#p160  </span></p>

Both vault bricks and wall bricks were found in the collapse. The vault bricks were evinced by the presence of markings on their faces as well as the way in which they were mortared together.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-8" href="#footnote-8">8</a></sup> The wall bricks from this room had strongly sooted plaster facing that matched one of the standing walls (F4) and probably derived from its collapse. Two complete vessels, a storage pot (Inv. 7977) and a flagon (Inv. 7652), were found within this matrix. Both vessels had mud plaster adhering to their bases. It is uncertain if this plaster was used to plaster these vessels into anything, namely in the roof that once existed above this room, or a wall niche, or if this plaster was simply the adherence of melted adobe upon the vessel bases. Also found within this matrix were several 75%–90% reconstructable vessels as well as moderate numbers of sherds. The ceramics appear to date to both the third and, especially, the fourth centuries CE. It must be borne in mind that this assemblage may be quite mixed due to the collapse of the roof. In addition to ceramics, moderate to high levels of clinker were found, particularly in the eastern half of the room. This clinker may derive from the ceramic kilns north of House B2. Small fragments of plaster were recovered especially in the vicinities of the walls F3 and F4. Some of the plaster was burned, while other fragments are black and possibly even red. We did not find colored plaster adhering to any of the walls.<a id="p161anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p161">↩</a><span id="p161anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p161">#p161  </span></p>

We found a concentric curved line pattern<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-9" href="#footnote-9">9</a></sup> and also the use of a triangular mud-brick and two chinking sherds between the rectangular vault bricks. Both the wedge shaped bricks and the rectangular vault bricks were sampled (S17 &amp; S19).<a id="p162anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p162">↩</a><span id="p162anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p162">#p162  </span></p>

This situation was most evident in the southwest quadrant of room 1. This erosion pattern signifies that the strong north wind was responsible for much of the erosion of this house. This wind appears to have eroded the entire northeast section of Amheida quite significantly, and the pattern of the finds also informs us that the majority of the deflation process took place after the walls of the structure had already collapsed.<a id="p163anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p163">↩</a><span id="p163anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p163">#p163  </span></p>

DSU 16 was the first secure context we encountered in room 1. It consisted of yellow sand with high densities of mud-brick debris that probably represented deterioration from the wall and ceiling as well as the erosion of collapse (DSU 4). Also included within this matrix were moderate to high densities of artifacts, particularly ceramics and clinker. Glass, wood, fauna, and plaster were also represented. We found a number of objects concentrated in the northeast corner of this context, including four Greek ostraka<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-11" href="#footnote-11">11</a></sup>, some of which are accounts of wine paid to various individuals. Some of these individuals were named while others were simply designated by their occupation.

This context was secure only in the portion underneath the mud-brick rubble layer (DSU 16). It consisted of a brown sandy matrix containing a sandy loam as well as gray ash and yellow sand patches. There were fewer mud-brick inclusions in DSU 21 than the DSUs that covered it (DSU 12, DSU 16). Artifact densities were moderate in the categories of ceramic, clinker, faience, quartzite, and plaster. Organics, such as wood fragments, fauna, and charcoal, were represented in moderate to high densities. There were also two fragments of burned textile that were too poorly preserved to identify.

We identified both a high ash content as well as a high density of organics, including charred seeds and perhaps straw. Artifact densities were moderate and mostly consisted of poorly preserved potsherds and clinker. It yielded one complete vessel, a partially blackened lid (Inv. 8749) and two mud stoppers (Inv. 3521, Inv. 3532).<a id="p166anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p166">↩</a><span id="p166anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p166">#p166  </span></p>

The floor was only preserved in the middle of the room, under the ceiling and wall collapse (DSU 4) and is a secure context. The floor eroded away in the rest of the room in an erosion pattern commonly found in adobe structures; the floors do not survive as well at points of junction with the walls. Moderate artifact densities typified this matrix, although two jar stoppers (Inv. 3521, Inv. 3532; see DSU 22 above) and two coins (Inv. 3730 and Inv. 3485) were found directly on top of, and slightly embedded within, this surface. The pressure of the collapse probably pressed these artifacts into the floor surface, and therefore we can interpret these objects as potential intrusions from DSU 22 into the floor surface. Other finds included potsherds, bone, wood, and clinker. There was also a single gold glass bead (Inv. 3066). The top of the floor layer consisted of a smoothed surface, underneath which we found compacted debris. The division between surface and debris was difficult to distinguish with certainty after we excavated beneath the top 5 cm of F11. Therefore, the floor was given a great depth of 17 cm. The floor thickness was difficult to determine, because it was so poorly preserved and lay above compacted layers that could also have served as floor layers but that were less well prepared than the one that we identified initially. A comparison of this floor with the other floors from this house is presented in the next chapter. This comparison is particularly valuable in this instance because we were able to distinguish floors and floor preparation layers excavated in the 2006 field season, because these floors were better preserved than those discovered in the 2005 field season.<a id="p167anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p167">↩</a><span id="p167anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p167">#p167  </span></p>

DSU 31 is secure and may be interpreted as a dump of material used to level the site surface prior to floor construction. The sherd sizes from this matrix were quite large, suggesting that it was probably used as fill to stabilize the floor. These sherds may date to the second to third centuries CE, signifying re-use of material from an earlier occupation. DSU 31 contained high densities of organics, both charred and unburned, such as seeds, charcoal, ash, and wood fragments. Clinker and dross (waste matter) were also present. The high density of ceramics included a nearly complete vessel (Inv. 9201). Two burned mud bricks and several extremely dense pockets of light gray ash were also associated with DSU 31. This DSU was terminated when we encountered either a compacted sandy matrix (DSU 23) or a matrix of sand with yellow sand and ash patches (DSU 21).<a id="p168anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p168">↩</a><span id="p168anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p168">#p168  </span></p>

There were low to moderate levels of artifacts, including ceramics, wood, fauna, clinker, and dross. There was one intact, lightly burned flagon (Inv. 9232). Some of the ceramics appeared to share characteristics with second to third century forms, which may be related to DSU 24, below. There were a few lenses of ash that contained burned olive and date pits, as well as wood and charcoal. The majority of the matrix consisted of compacted yellow sand in an uneven formation above the clean windblown sand (DSU 24) that was used as the surface upon which the walls of room 1 were built. DSU 23 had a weathered appearance and as such resembled DSU 20 in room 2 (see below). It was clear that the layer occurred beneath floor level (F11), as did DSU 20 in room 2. It seems likely that this sand and debris was used for packing and stabilizing beneath the floor level. This compacted weathered surface only occurred in the central part of the room, nearly never abutting the walls.

This matrix was excavated for only a few centimeters to insure that it marked the last anthropic material encountered in excavation for room 1. Some small quantities of material occurred in the top of the layer, as was found in the counterparts to this context in rooms 2 and 3 (DSU 26, 30). These top centimeters contained ceramics, wood, fauna, clinker, and dross. The ceramics shared characteristics with second to third century forms.

Presumably windblown sand came into the room, raising the surface, and then a minor burning episode took place, perhaps by squatters or passers-by. The wind deflation process of the walls occurred subsequent to some minor sand accumulation and this episode.<a id="p187anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p187">↩</a><span id="p187anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p187">#p187  </span></p>

These sherds present a heterogenous dating profile. Morphologically, the ceramics include storage jars, pots, and open forms such as plates and bowls. In addition to sherds, we also found moderate densities of glass, wood, clinker, faience, plaster, and glass slag. Some burned olive and date pits were also found. This deposition was quite shallow in the northwest corner, where the western door to room 7 (F52) was situated, and where it covered debris from wall and roof collapse below (DSU 6). On the other sides of the room, the unit was much thicker, as there was no collapse debris here. A complete bowl was found in the southwest corner of this room right next to the wall (Inv. 7978) at approximately 30 cm from the door to room 3. A faience amulet representing the Egyptian god Bes was also found (Inv. 3233). These objects cannot be connected directly to the B2 occupation, but may inform us about the vicinity around B2 in Area 1. An arbitrary division was made at a depth of approximately 50 cm in order to distinguish this surface sand from the windblown sand beneath the surface (DSU 5).<a id="p189anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p189">↩</a><span id="p189anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p189">#p189  </span></p>

This unit may be interpreted as the remnants of a floor, perhaps mixed with occupational debris. That this deposit was situated just above or at the same height as the foundation bricks in the north and south walls may sustain the theory that this matrix was once a floor or occupational level. The deposit lacked the strength and hardness characteristic of true floors, but it was also found above the threshold and rested directly on the threshold bricks. Artifact densities were high and we found iron-rich A group and A4 ceramics in addition to bone, wood, charcoal, plaster, and olive and date pits.

This context had the same appearance as DSU 23 in room 3, and it appeared to be a compacted surface. The layer was 20 cm thick at its maximum extent and contained a dense concentration of ceramics, all of which seem to be datable to the Roman Period and possibly the third century.

The layer contained no diagnostic pottery fragments, but various over-fired dynastic sherds were found in these compacted sand layers.

This foundation pattern changed approximately 20 cm in before the doorway into room 3. There, two bricks were placed horizontally, a header above a stretcher.

Although this floor level was made of compacted mud it was not a very hard surface, but it was the best-preserved floor level found in room 3, and in some respects it was more distinct than the floor visible in room 1.

The part of the floor that was preserved best was covered by the largest part of the collapse and was therefore a secure context. The lack of collapse over other parts of the floor may have left it open to the elements and caused erosion. Another possibility is that the pressures of the vault may have destroyed the rest of the floor, as could be seen in DSU 14, which was quite mixed due to the vault collapse penetrating through multiple stratigraphic units. Clay stoppers (Inv. 3180, Inv. 3525) were found embedded into this context, likely due to pressure from the vault pushing DSU 18 into F10.<a id="p223anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p223">↩</a><span id="p223anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p223">#p223  </span></p>

This context is similar to DSU 26 in room 2, which also contained a lens of debris that gave way to cleaner sand below. We excavated the layer to the bottom first course of the foundation bricks in the southeast corner of the room. A large pottery sherd, likely from a large cooking vessel, was found towards the bottom of the foundation layer. This sherd appears similar to fragments of a similar vessel found in the layer above (DSU 29) and may suggest a mixing of the layers in the upper centimeters of DSU 30. This context therefore consisted of contaminated windblown sand in the upper centimeters as well as clean windblown sand below. The ceramics included iron-rich fabric A and A4 as well as calcium-rich fabric P37. These ceramic materials indicate a second to third century date.

There were alternating headers and stretchers with 7 cm wide channels in between. The south channel was complete and extended for 180 cm. The south face of the wall was covered with reddish-brown mud plaster, but the brick-laying pattern was still visible as English bond. Immediately above floor level there was an extensive gouge and other wear that indicates heavy usage of the room. The gouge was repaired once or several times, as indicated by several pieces of baked brick and stone that were inserted into the gouge during occupation. The wall showed a clear repair face where mud mortar was used to cover this stabilizing fill. Prior to its repair in antiquity, the gouge was once greater than 20 cm wide and extended at least 220 cm before it reached the threshold at an approximate depth of 137.20. The wall was set upon one course of stretchers protruding 14 cm from the wall proper. These foundation bricks were not mortared together. The foundation bricks ran all the way to the west, where they met, and were bonded with, wall F7. Here, however, they lay under a threshold for the doorway F58 between room 2 and room 3. The foundation bricks on the south side of F6 consisted of one course of stretchers protruding approximately 3 cm from the wall proper. Underneath those stretchers was one course of headers placed vertically. The foundation bricks appeared to be set on clean windblown sand continuing to the bricks of F9 and F5, which seem to have been set in a foundation trench. The stretchers of F6 extended into the wall F7 and bond F6 to F7.

Here, the foundation bricks were formed by one course of stretchers protruding approximately 4–5 cm into the room and, underneath that, one course of headers placed vertically. The brick dimensions were the same as foundation bricks in other part of the wall. The bottom course of foundation bricks in wall F7 is set on a course of horizontally placed headers from the foundation of F8 in the most eastern end of the wall. The foundations of F7 and F8 thus partly overlapped. The foundation bricks consisted of one course of vertically placed headers without mortar. The foundation bricks were gray-brown in color and set on windblown sand. This foundation pattern changed approximately 20 cm before the doorway into room 3 (F58). There, two bricks were placed horizontally, a header above a stretcher. The east face of F7 was also the west face of the doorway between rooms 2 and 3 (F58). At the level of the threshold of the doorway between rooms 2 and 3, there was a large hole approximately 15 x 20 cm with a depth of 15 cm. This hole could have held a threshold beam.

The bonding pattern was English bond. The top of the wall was very badly eroded, but it was clear that the alternating channel method was used. The mud plaster facing was approximately 1 cm thick, but visible only in the top west corner of the north face. Starting approximately 75 cm from the west corner of the wall (moving east), there were three holes in the wall with diameters of approximately 7–10 cm and a depth of 10–25 cm (at least). The third hole terminated at 115 cm from the west end of the wall. The foundations were made up of seven courses of brick with a total height of 60 cm. The top course was built with headers placed horizontally and which protrude 30 cm from the wall. The entire foundation was an English bond, but its protrusion of 30 cm distinguished it from the rest of the wall. The tops of the foundation bricks were particularly weathered, appeared melted, and had accumulations of salt particles.

It is likely that the blackening resulted from the use of oil lamps in room 4. The northernmost 40 cm of F14 had mud plaster overlapping from vault F21 on to the south face. This vault (F21) springs off F14 (and wall F37 to the east). The vault springing seemed to be at a higher elevation to the south than to the north on F14 (see vault F21).

This wall abutted and was not bonded to any walls. There were eight courses of mud brick, the upper three of which corresponded to the lower part of the vault spring above F37. The preservation of the wall was fair, with some damage to the bricks and erosion of the mortar. The wall height was the same at both ends of the wall, with traces of mortar for the bedding of the course above at the north end of the wall.

The northern extremity of room 4 would therefore offer a shorter vertical space that the southern portion. The underside of the vault was completely covered in grayish-brown mud plaster. The cracks between the horizontal courses were clearly visible, and fourteen courses could be distinguished. The individual bricks within these courses were concealed. Some bricks from the vault collapse were found in DSU 44. They were curved rather than rectilinear vault bricks.

Likewise, the northern portion of the floor is better preserved because of the lack of traffic in this area. No other distinguishing marks are visible. Despite the comparanda from the Fayum, however, it is possible that room 4 may have been accessed through room 5 rather than a trap door. The southern end of room 4 was not closed off with a wall and there were some wood fragments in this vicinity. The lack of a wall in this portion of the room might be explained by poor preservation, but given that all other walls in this house have been well preserved, albeit at a low height, it seems possible that a door could have connected these two rooms.

The ash itself varied in color and consistency but not in sufficiently definable parameters to designate different contexts. The reliability was uncertain because it was not clear with which floor level the finds should be associated, and the context was not sealed by substantial collapse. The small finds associated with this context could be tentatively associated with floors on the basis of elevation. Glass, wood, bones, and clinker occurred in low densities, and we uncovered one date pit, five olive pits, eggshell fragments, and a textile fragment.

Unlike the floors beneath it (F41 and F47), F40 did not show signs of activities related to fire. This distinction might be the result of the position of the preserved portion of F40 rather than a change in the usage of room 1. For example, charred mud bricks associated with hearths were found in DSU 40 at an elevation that could be associated with either F40 or F41. The ashy matrix of DSU 40 and the charred bricks may indicate that the southwest quadrant of F40 was used for fire-related activities, while the heavily trafficked northeast quadrant of room 5 was free from such activities.

Although F41 was highly compacted and had other signatures of being a floor (such as flatness, the presence of flat-lying sherds, etc), its close proximity to floor F40 above suggests that it might have been a preparation layer rather than a proper floor. Otherwise it is possible that F40 represents a minor repair to a heavily worn area of F41. F41 was in a moderately good state of preservation, although it was largely absent in the southern third of the room. The northeastern quadrant of F41 was obscured by the presence of floor F40. The visible portion of F41, running approximately east–west across room 5, appeared to have been associated with multiple activities related to fire. The intensity of these activities may have catalyzed the destruction of floor F41 in the south, where a high density of ash, DSU 41, was found.

DSU 41 was terminated after we encountered F41, the second (middle) floor layer in room 5. We changed context designations so that we could have more control over determining the location of artifacts and with which floor layer they should be associated. The change in context was therefore based upon position and density of material. This matrix had a high density of ash, charcoal, and organic inclusions. The ceramics contained high densities of iron-rich fabric A group, low densities of calcium-rich fabric A11, B, and P37. The artifacts from this DSU are probably associated with the F41 floor occupation and included a carinated bowl (Inv. 10392), a nearly complete bowl (Inv. 10137), and a bread plate or lid with handle in many fragments.

The bricks are yellowish-brown in color, and their bonding pattern was English bond. The southern 360 cm of F14 had bricks in a moderate state of preservation as opposed to the northern portion in room 4, which was better preserved. There was a substantial gouge 0–353 cm north of the corner of F14 with F13. Its height varied from 0–20 cm above floor F47 to covering the entire vertical extent of F14. The depth of the gouge also varied greatly from 8 cm to possibly the entire width of the wall (not visible). At 160–220 cm from the corner with F13 a part of the rubble and sand filling the cavity was removed. This rubble consisted of largely intact ceramics and sherds. Most of this rubble was charred and highly burned. Given the proximity of hearths in this vicinity, fire probably catalyzed the fragile state of the wall here. Further south, F14 was abutted by F13, and reddish mud plaster was used in a coved shape between the two walls. The entire southern half of F14 had mild signs of soot or blackening, again, probably associated with the hearth or cooking activities. Directly opposite from F26 and F24, F14 had 6 cm deep indentations 0–19 cm from the top of the wall.

It was in a moderately good state of preservation, although it showed clear signs of wear and burning in its immediate vicinity. For example, there was a prominent burn spot on the wall 12–54 cm from the top of the wall and 40–90 cm from the southwest corner of F24. The bricks were set in an English bond pattern. The 7 lower courses were all set as stretchers, and the bricks of the upper course were all set as headers. The western corner was rounded by a combined action of occupational use and later weathering. The mortar between the bricks was dark yellow in color and made of a very high concentration of sand with almost no inclusions. The original mud plaster was, for the most part, missing, and only scanty traces of it were visible by some joints. It appeared to have been rich in fine lime inclusions, which created a light yellow color. The bricks themselves were beige in color. The wall was probably used to strengthen the corner of room 5 and room 4, if room 5 did indeed give access to the cellar. This hypothesis is substantiated by the way F24 abutted F26 running parallel to it. The wall appeared to be resting not on proper foundations but on the preparation layer of the floor in room 5 and thus represented a later addition to the room just after the initial occupation of B2.<a id="p273anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p273">↩</a><span id="p273anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p273">#p273  </span></p>

Wall F55 is in a low to moderate state of preservation. The wall retained a maximum of 7 courses above the foundations on in the northern portion of the wall, while the southern portion had barely 7 courses preserved. The remaining courses appeared to be stable. Most of the weathering was probably due to the wind. The bonding pattern for this wall was English bond, and the east face of the wall retained only very small patches of plaster. The southern portion of the wall face was better preserved than the northern portion. The northern portion had three gouges. The first gouge was 70–100 cm from the north boundary of F55 and was 0–13 cm above the bottom of the excavated area; it was 6 cm deep. The second gouge was 70–192 cm from the north boundary of F55, 5–12 cm above the bottom of the excavated area and 7 cm deep. The third gouge was 50–160 cm from the north boundary of F55, 28–39 cm above the bottom of the excavated area and 10 cm deep. It is likely that these gouges resulted from normal usage of room 5, which seems to have involved a lot of wear on the walls and floors. No other marks were visible on the wall. The tops of the foundation bricks were just barely visible in the southern 10 cm of the wall, standing vertically on their stretchers. Measurements of these foundations were not possible because they were not fully visible.

F26 was in a moderately good state of preservation, with the western portion preserved to a greater height than the eastern portion. The western end of the wall was highly deteriorated, partly due to heavy usage during the occupation of B2. The south face was covered with mud plaster 83–160 cm west of the east corner with F26. At 160–264 cm west of the east corner of F26 the south face was obscured by wall stub F24, which may have been built to repair or buttress F26. The visible bricks in the south face were built in English bond. They were highly weathered from occupational use, wind, and perhaps some minor water damage. The plastered area had a thick, 2.5 cm application of plaster with a high density of organic inclusions. Behind this plaster there were signs of burning, which may have accelerated the wall deterioration and necessitated the addition of wall F24. Most of the visible bricks were yellowish-brown in color, but the bottom course had reddish bricks, which projected 10 cm into the room. These bricks were probably for repairing the wall base rather than being a true foundation course, which tends (in this area) to stand on its headers. Some wood was evident in the west face of F26 in the vicinity of the space between this wall and wall F14.

The entrance into room 5 was somewhat narrow (60 cm) and elongated, removing it slightly from the central room of B2 (room 7). There was clearly no door located here, as there were no signs of a threshold or pivot for a door, and the flooring and walls were sufficiently preserved to evince these signatures had they been present. Room 5 was one of the larger rooms in B2, being smaller only than room 7. This room showed the most significant signs of burning, debris, and cooking activity among all of the rooms.<a id="p276anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p276">↩</a><span id="p276anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p276">#p276  </span></p>

Second, it was necessary to move from the stairway to the flat roofs over rooms 1, 2, 3, and 6. Room 5 provided the only clear means of access between the staircase (room 8) and these other rooms. There is no evidence for the appearance or extent of this possible roof.<a id="p277anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p277">↩</a><span id="p277anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p277">#p277  </span></p>

The walls appear to have been modified marginally during occupation. For example, wall stub F24 appears to have been added after the initial occupation of the structure. Other minor modifications included repairs to the walls, such as F14, which contained a large amount of debris used to shore up an area of heavy wear. These walls seem to have undergone more extreme usage than the walls in the other rooms of B2 and many of them, particularly F14, showed signs of fire in their vicinity. The signs of burning likely derived from active cooking in this vicinity, as the burn marks were quite large, particularly on F14. The foundations of the walls were partially visible on wall F55 and appear consistent with construction techniques elsewhere in B2.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-112" href="#footnote-112">112</a></sup><a id="p278anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p278">↩</a><span id="p278anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p278">#p278  </span></p>

All of the floors showed signatures of fire, burning, and ash. A hearth feature (F46) was on top of floor F47, and floor F41 had an informal hearth consisting of stacked mud bricks.<a id="p279anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p279">↩</a><span id="p279anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p279">#p279  </span></p>

This room appeared to have been modified marginally during its phases of occupational usage, and all of these modifications appeared to be necessitated for stabilizing the room because of its intensive use for fire. This preponderance of data suggests that cooking took place here. In most households of Late Antiquity, cooking probably took place on portable braziers of bronze or pottery in the courtyard of the house. Materials related to cooking activity such as cooking pots, mortaria, frying pans, and metal implements such as knives are frequently found in domestic contexts and indicate such activities.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-113" href="#footnote-113">113</a></sup> In a Romano-Egyptian context we can understand the presence of hearths, firedogs, and cooking vessels to be the most significant indices of food preparation outside of bread ovens.

It was laid in English bond, as was the rest of wall F12, which served as the east part of this doorway. The threshold was well preserved apart from one missing brick at the center of the uppermost course on the south side. The threshold consisted of wall courses continuing below the doorway rather than a separate construction element.

The bonding pattern was English bond, and the alternating channels construction method was used. The south face of the wall was weathered and seemed to have suffered from some minor water damage. There was no mud plaster visible. There was a light burn mark 60–75 cm east of wall F55 that was 8–14 cm above the foundation level. Some insignificant burning episode probably occurred in this vicinity, potentially after the structure was abandoned. Two courses of the foundation were visible here, and both had the bricks resting on their stretchers. The top course protruded into the room from the wall proper by 9 cm.

The central part was well preserved, but the lower portions to the north and south ends were destroyed when the wooden thresholds of the doorways (F51, F52) were removed. A thick layer of mud plaster containing abundant organic material and some relatively large potsherds largely obscured this face of the wall. At the south end of the wall this plaster overlay a similar plaster that was pale red in color, traces of which could also be seen on the south side of doorway F52 (see F52 description).

It was in a good state of preservation with the western portion preserved to a greater height than the eastern portion. The south face of the wall was covered in a reddish-brown mud plaster that had organic, pebble, ceramic, and lime spot inclusions. This mud plaster obscured most of the individual mud bricks, but it was possible to determine that the bonding pattern was English bond. The bricks were, for the most part, yellowish-brown in color, although there were some reddish bricks as well. In the 144 cm of F32 that provided the north boundary to room 7 there was a gypsum plaster band over the mud plaster. It was 32–73 cm above floor F45 and thus extended to the top of the preserved height of F32. The gypsum plaster originally may have extended to floor level, because its bottom edge was rough from breakage and was not the original lower end of the plaster. This gypsum plaster, and the mud plaster below, cove at the corners between this wall and wall F4 and this wall with wall F36. This coving was approximately 4 cm thick, while the gypsum plaster was less than 0.5 cm thick. The gypsum plaster is somewhat blackened and grayed in the corners, likely due to the presence of the oven feature (F19) close by. In plan-view the wall clearly used the alternating channels method. The channel was 9 cm wide and varied greatly in length. The foundations of wall F32 were not visible in room 7, but the coving with floors F44 and F45 was evident.

The brick-bonding pattern was obscured by mud plaster. The join where this wall abutted the adjacent north–south wall to the west (F34) was filled with gray-brown mud that was quite different in color from the wall plaster. The upper face of the wall was uneven and was apparently preserved to its original height.

The presence of a large number of olive pits and other seeds embedded into the floor suggests that these goods may have been stored on the roof that once covered other rooms within the house. Indeed, some of the jars found embedded in roof collapse (rooms 1 and 6) may have derived from the roof and could have served as storage vessels for these items. The presence of windblown sand (DSU 55) immediately above the occupational debris (DSU 60) likely derives from sand blowing in from open areas surrounding the stairs. The collapse of surrounding walls then sealed this area before it was covered with yet more windblown sand.<a id="p352anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p352">↩</a><span id="p352anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p352">#p352  </span></p>

At 65 cm from the corner with F30 there was a crack running down the entire east face. There was an additional large gouge to the north associated with doorway F50. There was a thin depression 64–84 cm north of the corner with F30. It was 100–113 cm above floor F44 and 3 cm deep. The cause of this depression may also be related to doorway F50.

The western extent of the wall was abutted by doorway F50. Both F32 and F50 appeared worn from the frequent usage of this doorway. There was a hole or socket 12–28 cm east of the junction between F32 and F34. It was 31–45 cm above where wall F43 meets F32 and was 9 cm deep.

Wall F33 does not belong to the original construction of House B2 but rather served as a later addition. The south face of F33 shows the English bond construction pattern and does not show segmented construction because the segments run east–west and not north–south.

It was in a moderately good state of preservation. It consisted of 2 steps formed by 5 limestone blocks used as steps up 12–15 cm to the street. The jambs on either side of the blocks were constructed out of mud brick. These jambs bonded to the walls on either side (F32 and F31). The blocks were of irregular dimensions and, although they were generally rectangular in shape, some of them were quite irregular. One of the blocks contained approximately 18 gouges. The dimensions of the clearest gouges were: (1) 7 x 1.5 cm; 1.5 cm deep; (2) 6 x 1 cm; less than 1 cm deep; (3) 4.5 x 0.5 cm; less than 1 cm deep. Most of the gouges ran north–south but a few were diagonal. The cause of these gouges is not certain, but it is possible that the block was used as an informal whetting stone. Abutting wall F32 was a mud-brick jamb that was so heavily weathered that it was not possible to see if there were sockets for the door. The northernmost 16 cm protruded west by 16 cm, creating a narrowing of the doorway aperture. The western portion of the doorway made use of F31, the west wall of room 9. Wall F31 was in a better state of preservation than the western portion of the doorway itself, potentially because of the removal of wood from the doorway in antiquity. Doorway F50 had a depressed area 9–292 cm above the lower western limestone block and 0–280 cm north of the block’s south boundary. It was 3 cm deep. It was probably caused by weathering and use. Doorway F50 was plastered into floor F44 with mud plaster in its bottom course of blocks.

Such locks were standard in domestic structures. The doorway to the street was modified over time to compensate for the rising street level. The stairs belonging to the doorway (F50) were added after the initial occupation of the structure. The aperture leading to room 7 did not contain a door, as there was no threshold or pivot evident, and the architecture was sufficiently preserved to indicate one had it been present.<a id="p367anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p367">↩</a><span id="p367anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p367">#p367  </span></p>

The upper face of the wall was uneven and seems to have been preserved to its original height. The wall was two brick-widths wide, and the north row of bricks was covered in its east part by a channel. This channel was lined with a thick layer of mud plaster (0.7–1.0 cm thick), with a 0.5–1.0 cm thick white plaster. These plaster layers formed an L-shaped channel, which turned northwards to the west of F36 and above F43. The channel ended one brick-length from the adjacent wall to the west (F34), with the upper brick course offset slightly to the north to create a 7.5 cm lip that was coated in mud plaster.

The collapse on the east side of the trench was more “melted” and less distinct than on the west side. Over a dozen vault bricks were eventually found among the wall bricks, mostly close to the north wall of B2. Mixed in with the bricks was a considerable amount of small, broken, gravelly, brick debris. Many levels of bricks were superimposed. There were high densities of iron-rich fabric A and A4 group, and moderate densities of calcium-rich fabric A11 and B. Of note is that seven sherds were covered in a resinous, tar-like black substance. Glass, bones, and dross occurred in moderate densities, while clinker occurred in great densities. Much of this refuse probably originated from the kilns north of B2. There was one apricot pit. Two terracotta figurine fragments were found (Inv. 11628 and Inv. 11633). The bone, some of which showed signs of burning, appeared to be from a single large animal, and it is possible that it derived from the modern village north of the site. At this stage, however, it is not possible to confirm or deny the contamination of this context. Small objects were found just beneath the collapse layer, in DSU 5. DSU 3 was terminated when no more dense associations of mud brick were found and when DSU 5, a sandy matrix with many inclusions of small sherds and clinker, was found.

The presence of two fragments of a single figurine distributed between two contexts<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-238" href="#footnote-238">238</a></sup> indicates a degree of interpenetration for these two contexts. Among the ceramics, we found a high density of iron-rich fabric A and A4 group and low to moderate densities of calcium-rich fabric A11 and B. There were two A-group over-fired body sherds that appeared to be melted; these probably derived from the kilns across the street. There was also one A36 Nile Valley imported body sherd, and a 75% complete bowl (Inv. 11734) was also preserved. Faience and glass occurred in low densities. Bone occurred in moderate densities and clinker occurred in high densities. A large number of ash pockets were found as well as a donkey hoof.

All of the inclusions were quite small, signifying heavy wear and traffic over this context. DSU 6 grew increasingly compact and more intensely yellow with depth. In the northeastern quadrant of the context there was a large ash pocket with a sherd scatter, consisting of large sherds. It was probably a secondary trash deposit.

The southeast corner maintained the yellow windblown sand characteristic of DSU 5. The presence of misshapen ceramic “wasters” (e.g., a handle collapsed onto a body) may indicate secondary waste deposits from the kilns north of Street S1. Similar wasters were found in DSU 5, which may indicate that the kilns were contemporaneous with the house during at least part of its occupation or, at the very least, with the street usage. These ceramics likely date to the third century. This context contained high inclusions of organic material, especially bone, and clinker. Plaster occurred in low densities, and one fragment was painted dark red and light green. Iron-rich fabric A and A4 group occurred in high densities. Calcium-rich fabric B group occurred in moderate densities. Wood and plaster occurred in low densities. Charcoal, several olive pits, and mortar were found.

The context was extremely flat, except for the western portion, which slopes upwards slightly, and seems to have been a prepared street surface, perhaps the lowest (first) street level. As such, it is probably equal to DSU 14 to the west. The thickness of this context was difficult to ascertain, because it was present only in a small northeastern portion of the excavated area in the trench. The southernmost 50 cm appear to have been excavated earlier in a trench from a previous campaign that we have not been able to identify.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-244" href="#footnote-244">244</a></sup> We drew a section of the east sidewall of the Area 1.2 trench with this prior trench visible in the baulk (Figure 4.40).

There was some glass and a handful of baked brick fragments. This context was very similar to the gray ash above (DSU 8), but a distinction between the layers was made on the basis of position; DSU 8 is above a “surface” (DSU 10), while DSU 11 was below DSU 8.

This context contained a ceramic scatter in the eastern edge of the east–west section, which yielded a vessel with two spouts (Inv. 11933) and a bread plate (Inv. 12216). The western and northern areas of the context were much cleaner, with very few inclusions. Another possible kiln waster was found in the context, which extends the active period of the kilns back in time, as it was once conjectured that the kilns were only a very late addition on this street.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-247" href="#footnote-247">247</a></sup> Our other ceramic finds included iron-rich fabric A group in very high densities and calcium-rich fabric A11 and B in moderate to high densities.

Other inclusions were bone and charcoal in low to moderate densities. This context probably represented the last proper road surface in Street S1 and may also have served as a sort of trash barrier for the doorway to B2. It thus seems that this context is a counterpart to another compacted matrix (DSU 7). The context was terminated when a highly compacted surface was found (DSU 6).

The thickness and elevation of F2 was highly variable, varying between 0.5 cm and 15 cm or more. The thickness increased to the west and may reflect an attempt to even out a naturally hilly topography. In the southern portion of the trench, F2 was missing from the southernmost 1 meter of the trench. The lack of F2 in this area may be due to a trench dug in this area by a prior expedition to this site (see the description for F3 below). We removed the northern portion of F2 in the part of the trench because it appeared to be a patchy lens in DSU 8. To the west, the feature was quite thick and was built directly on top of F1, with no rubble or sand in between. To the west, it was also greater in elevation.

<h2>Courtyard C2 (Subarea 1.4)</h2>

It was thought to be an exterior courtyard belonging to B2, since the entrance to it is located just east of B2, and B2 was the house in the closest proximity to C2. Alternatively, we thought that the courtyard could have been a communal or shared courtyard, since it is surrounded by houses on all sides and is the only obvious large open space within the immediate vicinity of Area 1. Subsequent excavations in C2, still in progress as this volume went to press, reveal that it was a rectangular shape. A house (B9), identical in size and similar in layout to B2, occupies the area east of B2.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-259" href="#footnote-259">259</a></sup> Courtyard C2 belongs to House B9 and not to B2. Even so, our test trench informs interpretations of B2. We chose to excavate a trench (C2A) in Courtyard C2 in order to determine the function of a space in the immediate vicinity of B2 as well as determine comparative phasing with the house and the street.<a id="p446anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p446">↩</a><span id="p446anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p446">#p446  </span></p>

We laid out a 6 m north–south x 2 m east–west oriented trench against the south wall of B2 and the west wall of Courtyard C2, since wind deflation has a lesser effect towards the west and north. This trench was later expanded by an additional 4.2 x 2.0 m to the south and 1.5 x 1.5 m to the east, against the south wall of Courtyard C2. We expanded the trench because additional features (F4 and F5) became visible in the course of excavating the 4.2 x 2.0 m trench (Figures 4.42, 4.43).<a id="p447anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p447">↩</a><span id="p447anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p447">#p447  </span></p>

This collapse may derive from the unexcavated structure to the west of Courtyard C2. Because of the small amount of concentric circle design bricks, it is presumed that DSU 8 mostly consisted of wall collapse. The mud brick fragments of DSU 6 must have interpenetrated DSU 2.

Only one course was preserved for most of it, and only two courses were preserved on its east wall. Together with F3 to the west, F4 was built into the southwest corner of Courtyard C2. Including all of the walls, the feature itself consisted of a rectangle of mud-brick 138 x 102 cm. This feature was found below room fill (DSU 9) and was filled by oven fill (DSU 11). The diameter for the circular interior of the oven was approximately 85 cm, but it was very poorly preserved and present only in patches. The area between the circular interior and the rectangular mud-brick exterior was filled with ash and mud brick. The draft hole of the oven was visible in the east wall of the feature. It was 7.5 cm from the bottom of F4, as measured from the exterior. The top part of the draft hole was missing, so it was not possible to say how high up it extended. The north–south oriented draft hole was 38–63 cm north of F5 (the south boundary of the feature). The platform (F3) for oven F4 was preserved to the west.

F5 abuts wall F6 to the west. There is a slight gap between the two walls, from 3 to 5 cm, where the abutment occurs. The wall was built using the alternating channel construction method. No plaster remained adhering to the north face of the wall, so the bonding pattern was clearly visible as English bond, although it becomes irregular approximately 85 cm east of the abutment between walls F5 and F6. Much of F5 was obscured by the presence of an oven platform (F3) and oven (F4) that abut F5.

F13 abuts wall F56 and it was shaped in a step pattern around the foundations and an indention west of F56.

In addition to these organic remains, an oven and an oven platform were found built into the southwest corner of the courtyard. They were in a poor state of preservation, with only the bottom course of bricks remaining. The northern 6 x 2 m of the trench contained low to moderate densities of material remains and included a complete bowl, a loom weight, and first half of the third century CE ostrakon (Inv. 11723 = <i>O.Trim.</i> 1.51).

A fragment of textile (Inv. 11527), of a type that was produced only in the third century, provides additional datable material. The ceramic assemblage suggests a third-century occupation, perhaps extending into the early fourth century.
