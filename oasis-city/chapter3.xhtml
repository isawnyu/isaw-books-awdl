    <meta name="DC.abstract" content="Scattered through the vast expanse of stone and sand that makes up Egypt's Western Desert are several oases. These islands of green in the midst of the Sahara owe their existence to springs and wells drawing on ancient aquifers. In antiquity, as today, they supported agricultural communities, going back to Neolithic times but expanding greatly in the millennium from the Saite pharaohs to the Roman emperors. New technologies of irrigation and transportation made the oases integral parts of an imperial economy.     Amheida, ancient Trimithis, was one of those oasis communities. Located in the western part of the Dakhla Oasis, it was an important regional center, reaching a peak in the Roman period before being abandoned. Over the past decade, excavations at this well-preserved site have revealed its urban layout and brought to light houses, streets, a bath, a school, and a church. The only standing brick pyramid of the Roman period in Egypt has been restored. Wall-paintings, temple reliefs, pottery, and texts all contribute to give a lively sense of its political, religious, economic, and cultural life. This book presents these aspects of the city's existence and its close ties to the Nile valley, by way of long desert roads, in an accessible and richly illustrated fashion."/>

Most other cities are concealed by modern towns on the same footprint, but in the case of Amheida only some areas of sand hide the ancient layout, down to the level of individual rooms, from our eyes. Fortunately, it has been possible to map most of the village of Kellis, allowing us to compare these two settlements. Because only a small fraction of Amheida has been excavated—and even if we spent many years on the task it would never be possible to dig all of it—a topographical survey of the site has been a major objective from the beginning, in order to allow us to understand the urban character of Trimithis.<a id="p100anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p100">↩</a><span id="p100anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p100">#p100  </span></p>

However, several parts of the plan are still blank because of the presence of a thick coat of sand covering the buildings (<a href="#figure45">Fig. 45</a>). Moreover, the area west of the city is hidden under sand dunes that move toward the south at a speed of about 7 m per year. This natural phenomenon enabled us to discover and plot a new quarter of the settlement in 2013 (Area 11) (<a href="#figure46">Fig. 46</a>). Our knowledge will grow in the future as the dunes continue to move. Magnetometry and conductivity surveys have also been carried out, but these have added little to our knowledge of the building plans, mainly because the mud bricks and the fill surrounding them do not differ significantly in magnetic properties that are the essential data captured by such surveys, and they therefore cannot be distinguished from one another.<sup><a id="footnote-reference-3.1" class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-3.1">1</a></sup> The vast necropolis to the south of the settlement still needs to be recorded.<a id="p101anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p101">↩</a><span id="p101anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p101">#p101  </span></p>

The plan cannot take into account the different phases of the settlement, and the degree of erosion and of sand accumulation will have varied according to eras and areas—factors that have surely determined the buildings' different states of preservation as well as interfering with our perception of the urban layout. Different stages of erosion can be easily recognized even on the site surface today: a few buildings still stand, up to several meters high, while others have been eroded to floor level; in most cases, the degradation has reached the ground floor ceiling (§<a href="chapter1.xhtml#chapter1.1">1.1</a>).<a id="p103anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p103">↩</a><span id="p103anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p103">#p103  </span></p>

It is clear, however, that most of this surface pottery comes from the eroded walls and roofs—pottery was massively used in their construction, as the local building technique confirms (<a href="#figure47">Fig. 47</a>). We cannot tell how much older the pottery sherds reused in the masonry are than the living phase of the buildings until we proceed with a proper excavation. Pottery that was sitting on the roof at the time of abandonment will normally belong to the same period as the final occupation.<a id="p104anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p104">↩</a><span id="p104anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p104">#p104  </span></p>

Pottery and other objects from earlier periods, which are found all over the area, show that this was the last phase of a settlement active from at least the Old Kingdom onwards. The older settlement stood possibly at the center of the present archaeological area. After centuries of stratification it formed a <i>kom</i> or <i>tell</i>, at present the central hill on top of which the successive temples of Thoth were built, culminating in the temple of the first century <span class="smallcaps">CE</span>. The Roman-period temple was dismantled, probably in Ottoman times, along with several walls and buildings, to acquire construction material. A great <i>temenos</i> with an irregular perimeter wall originally surrounded the sacred area, which was probably entered by three gates on the east, north, and west sides. According to a virtual reconstruction of the Roman temple—based on limited evidence, it must be said—it was oriented toward the southeast. We would therefore expect there to have been a <i>dromos</i>, or processional street, crossing the main core of the Roman settlement in front of it. However, no traces of such a monumental street have been found on the surface among the fourth-century buildings. One would expect that the Imperial town was built around the main temple, partly in an area that is now blank on the plan because of the sand covering the slopes of the hill.<a id="p105anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p105">↩</a><span id="p105anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p105">#p105  </span></p>

Houses in Area 11 have not yet been excavated; their date is suggested on the basis of the surface pottery (<a href="#figure48">Fig. 48</a>). If the third-century date can be confirmed, this part of the settlement would have been far beyond the visible western limit of fourth-century Trimithis, and a counterpart to Area 1. At present, we cannot say whether the settlement of the early Imperial period spread all over the archaeological site, buried as it is under sand and the fourth-century city. The Roman baths (§<a href="chapter3.xhtml#chapter3.2">3.2</a>) and the temple, made of stone blocks and carefully decorated with painted bas-reliefs in the first century <span class="smallcaps">CE</span>, seem to testify to a rich and sophisticated society. A coin hoard of about 860 billon coins of the first and second centuries <span class="smallcaps">CE</span> (almost all tetradrachms minted in Alexandria) found in the temple area points to the same conclusion (<a href="#figure49">Fig. 49</a>).<a id="p106anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p106">↩</a><span id="p106anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p106">#p106  </span></p>

If it was, we still cannot say how much it thrived in each of the various periods. The geography of the oasis, and the presence of good supplies of water that allowed agriculture to flourish, explain why a permanent settlement was established here. Considering the ancient sites of all periods surveyed throughout the oasis by the Dakhleh Oasis Project,<sup><a id="footnote-reference-3.4" class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-3.4">4</a></sup> it is hardly surprising that the western part, of which Amheida was at the center, includes several ruined sites dating from the Old Kingdom to the Islamic period. In all likelihood, Amheida stood on a major road, like today's Darb Farafra. This ancient track approached Dakhla from the north, coming down from the escarpment just behind El-Qasr, then continued southward, possibly following the path of the modern paved road and connecting several settlements on the way to Mothis.<a id="p107anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p107">↩</a><span id="p107anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p107">#p107  </span></p>

Although it is difficult to determine when these were productive, their large number testifies to a generally good supply of water. The huge spring mound located south of Trimithis (mentioned in the introduction) lies in the vicinity of the necropolis, its outlet toward the north (see figure 12). The cemetery spreads over a flat area 1.5 km long and is characterized by a concentration of tombs, situated especially on mounds and natural hills. Traces of channels and springs invite us to suppose that the tombs used to be interspersed among cultivated fields (<a href="#figure50">Fig. 50</a>).<a id="p108anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p108">↩</a><span id="p108anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p108">#p108  </span></p>

Taking parts now under sand into account, the area in ancient times was no doubt larger, although we cannot tell how much was occupied during each period.<a id="p109anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p109">↩</a><span id="p109anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p109">#p109  </span></p>

Baked bricks, squared stones, and wood were probably in more frequent use than we can appreciate today, but they were massively plundered for building material for new settlements during the site's long abandonment.<a id="p110anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p110">↩</a><span id="p110anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p110">#p110  </span></p>

The geomorphology here will have influenced the layout of the settlement, in which some groups of houses and streets follow a different orientation from the dominant one—such as, for example, Area 1, with its Street 1 oriented northeast–southwest. Similarly, some streets and alleys follow a curvilinear path, caused by a change in the slope or following a natural terrace, while others cut across the slope abruptly. Terraces artificially supported by substructures and walls belonging to buildings were used at least on the slopes of the central temple hill, where dense habitation quarters and large buildings have been documented, especially on the east and south slopes. Containment walls clearly mark the south end of the settlement, where a steep step separates the habitations from the south necropolis (<a href="#figure52">Fig. 52</a>).<a id="p111anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p111">↩</a><span id="p111anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p111">#p111  </span></p>

The layout is very dense, and from the surface it is not everywhere obvious where the alleys are or where they lead (<a href="#figure53">Fig. 53</a>). At times, the network of walls seems to close off every possible passageway, in a sort of labyrinth. The most regular buildings, aligned on orthogonal streets, are in the center of Area 2 east of the temple, and in Area 11. But the widest street, Street 1 in Area 1, has a completely different orientation from the others, and appears to be isolated or at least not directly linked to other streets (<a href="#figure54">Fig. 54</a>). Its considerable width (7 m) suggests that it was the most important road, but it ends abruptly, and the buildings on both sides are ordinary houses of the third century <span class="smallcaps">CE</span>.

Certainly, it cannot be considered a major highway (<a href="#figure55">Fig. 55</a>). The roads are of varying widths, from a maximum of 7 m to as little as 1.5. Their edges, formed by the irregular alignment of buildings, also feature sudden variations in width. The most regular pattern is in Area 11, where the streets seem, in contrast to other areas, to have been built on level ground on a grid: they are orthogonal, compass-oriented and hierarchical, the inner roads being 2.3 m wide and the main ones about double that size (4.8 and 5.5 m).<a id="p113anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p113">↩</a><span id="p113anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p113">#p113  </span></p>

Moreover, these alleys turned out on investigation to be partially covered with flat roofs made of palm beams, or in one case partly with a mud-brick barrel vault. The spaces in front of the doors in the streets were left uncovered, so as to allow the light to enter the houses (<a href="#figure56">Fig. 56</a>).<sup><a id="footnote-reference-3.6" class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-3.6">6</a></sup><a id="p114anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p114">↩</a><span id="p114anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p114">#p114  </span></p>

Although the plans of the buildings, as far as we are able to detect them, are not well defined, we know that alongside the wide, wealthy ones, the commonest houses were originally built on a square plan, apparently following two principal standard dimensions—about 15 × 15 and 11 × 10 m. These correspond to the average dimensions of <span class="reference" rel="dcterms:references" typeof="owl:NamedIndividual"><a rel="rdfs:isDefinedBy" href="http://www.amheida.com/contexts/show/NzE=" property="rdfs:label" target="_new">B1</a></span> and <span class="reference" rel="dcterms:references" typeof="owl:NamedIndividual"><a rel="rdfs:isDefinedBy" href="http://www.amheida.com/contexts/show/NzI=" property="rdfs:label" target="_new">B2</a></span>, respectively the house of Serenos and a house excavated in Area 1.<sup><a id="footnote-reference-3.9" class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-3.9">9</a></sup> However, it is also clear that buildings changed their original regular shapes by the addition of rooms, extending into nearby spaces, or by annexing rooms of adjacent buildings, as happened in Serenos' house (§<a href="chapter3.xhtml#chapter3.3">3.3</a>). This practice was facilitated by the fact that the buildings were not freestanding but had party walls. This way of building permits the saving of goodly quantities of bricks and labor and contributes to creating the impression of a labyrinthine network of walls and rooms. The commonest kind of ceiling was the vault, but domes were used in the main square rooms, and wooden beams covered with palm branches were also employed to roof some rooms. Most of the houses have a staircase leading to upper floors or to a terraced roof (<a href="#figure58">Fig. 58</a>). Few of the visible buildings show clearly the presence of a second story, but this does not necessarily mean that they did not exist.<a id="p116anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p116">↩</a><span id="p116anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p116">#p116  </span></p>

However, the data collected via the topographic and ceramic surveys suggest that the settlement was extensive and quite rich; the amphoras found include imports from the eastern Mediterranean.<sup><a id="footnote-reference-3.11" class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-3.11">11</a></sup> Third-century houses have been identified in Areas 1 and 11, and an impressive, Roman-style public bath has been found in Area 2, below the fourth-century buildings. This last was an unexpected find, as regards both the nature of the building and its huge dimensions (approximately 41 × 34 m).<a id="p120anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p120">↩</a><span id="p120anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p120">#p120  </span></p>

The area excavated so far is approximately 1000 m<sup>2</sup> and includes Serenos' house (B1), a school of Greek subsequently transformed into a workshop/stable (<span class="reference" rel="dcterms:references" typeof="owl:NamedIndividual"><a rel="rdfs:isDefinedBy" href="http://www.amheida.com/contexts/show/NzY=" property="rdfs:label" target="_new">B5</a></span>; see Chapter 6), and an imposing edifice with a peristyle hall (B6)—the building that turned out to be the last form of the public bath. These structures were active during the fourth century and were abandoned, presumably, well before the end of that century. They were built at least partly on the ruins of the earlier Roman bath, which itself was built directly on the natural cemented dune. We still have no precise evidence for dating the foundation of this bath, which was abandoned, in all likelihood, no later than the end of the third century. What we have found are the remains of rooms, walls, channels, and floors that survived after years of abandonment and demolition and were then hidden or reused as foundations for the new buildings; plus other rooms that were renovated to become a new smaller bath in the second half of the fourth century (B6). The stratigraphic excavation of the area brought us to the conclusion that after its abandonment the bath was extensively quarried for building materials and at the same time used as a dumping space (<a href="#figure61">Fig. 61</a>).<a id="p121anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p121">↩</a><span id="p121anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p121">#p121  </span></p>

The bath was built with baked and unbaked bricks; stones were also used at some points, as well as wood (<a href="#figure62">Fig. 62</a>).<a id="p122anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p122">↩</a><span id="p122anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p122">#p122  </span></p>

Its uneven state of preservation and the limited possibility of investigation because of the presence of other buildings on top of its ruins do not so far permit us a precise view or a coherent virtual reconstruction of its phases. In all, twenty-three rooms or parts of rooms and pools have been identified, but in many cases we do not know their functions. The Imperial-period bath was half demolished and leveled after decades of abandonment, and it was on its ruins that Serenos' house and a school were built. The north half of the building, rebuilt as the new, smaller bath mentioned above, was characterized by a central pillared room (B6) (<a href="#figure63">Fig. 63</a>).<a id="p124anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p124">↩</a><span id="p124anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p124">#p124  </span></p>

The bathers could come into the building through any of three entrances located on the west and north streets. Then they had to pass through the entrance rooms (<i>vestibula</i>) and enter the main pillared hall, Room 24 (the <i>frigidarium</i>) (<a href="#figure65">Fig. 65</a>). To take a proper bath they had to cross the small Room 32, probably a <i>tepidarium</i>. A first hot room (Room 42) with a single bathtub was connected with the main bathing room, in which were two hot pools.<a id="p125anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p125">↩</a><span id="p125anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p125">#p125  </span></p>

The square pool (about 2.5 × 2 m) was surrounded by a sidewalk of limestone slabs and reached a depth of about one meter. Both pools served as full-immersion baths for a small number of people at a time; the water was kept clean by constant exchange, thanks to drains for the wastewater located at the bottom.<a id="p126anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p126">↩</a><span id="p126anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p126">#p126  </span></p>

For privacy, the door of the <i>latrina</i> opened at the end of a narrow, blind corridor. The <i>latrina</i>'s floor is missing, probably because it was made of wood, of which traces survive on the walls. The toilet seats were probably of a squat type set into the wooden floor.

Four additional excavated channels conveyed the air from the hypocaust toward the outside by means of four round pottery <i>tubuli</i> inserted into the wall of the round room.<a id="p130anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p130">↩</a><span id="p130anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p130">#p130  </span></p>

Water already used for bathing would have flowed into the channels from two side-rooms through two openings in the walls, then circulated counter-clockwise to be drained through an underground sewer channel opening in the northeast corner of the <i>latrina</i>.<a id="p132anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p132">↩</a><span id="p132anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p132">#p132  </span></p>

A square pedestal supported a <i>labrum</i>, a wide stone water basin, found broken on the floor, while a raised baked-brick platform (3.10 × 3.40 m) stood at the room's northeast corner. Although it was buried and covered by later features after having being partly demolished, it is still possible to reconstruct its shape and function: at its center was a sunken basin (2.35 × 2.15 m) or tub made of waterproof plaster. The basin was about one meter deep, had rounded corners and three rounded steps in its northwest corner, to allow for gradual immersion into the water, which was probably supplied by hand.

The considerable size of the bath along with this important restyling and enlargement work, done in the Imperial period, allow us to imagine a rich and sophisticated society living in the third-century oasis. This chronology is also suggested by the widely held view that baths with hypocausts are rare in first-century Egypt, and that this technology started to spread, slowly, only from the second century on. Despite a drastic reduction in dimensions during the second half of the fourth century when B6 was constructed—a phenomenon common at that time—the bath was intended to be a richly decorated building, with its columned porches, pillars, and at least a mosaic floor.<a id="p136anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p136">↩</a><span id="p136anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p136">#p136  </span></p>

Their dates are also different: B1 was built around 330–340, while B2 seems to belong to the middle or third quarter of the third century <span class="smallcaps">CE</span> and was abandoned perhaps a half-century before B1.<sup><a id="footnote-reference-3.18" class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-3.18">18</a></sup><a id="p139anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p139">↩</a><span id="p139anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p139">#p139  </span></p>

Serenos, the central figure in the ostraka found in the occupation levels of this mud-brick house, is the name of its owner. The building has been well known since the Dakhleh Oasis Project survey discovered its decoration, comprising brightly colored painted scenes, in 1979. The original plan of the house (15 × 15 m) is not substantially different from that of B2: a central room gave access to the other rooms and to the staircase that leads to a second floor or a terraced roof (<a href="#figure58">Fig. 58</a>, <a href="#figure68">Fig. 68</a>). The main differences in the plan are the presence in Serenos' house of a dining room covered by a dome and of three entrances from the streets that flanked the building to the east and west. Most of the rooms were barrel-vaulted, while the hub of the house (Room 2) and Room 6 were flat-roofed. Although B1 is better preserved than B2, thanks to a rapid covering by sand, the house suffered from moisture and termites, which damaged the mud plaster, rich in straw, and all the other organic items and remains.<a id="p140anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p140">↩</a><span id="p140anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p140">#p140  </span></p>

Baked bricks were reused, too, but only in moderate quantity in Serenos' house.<sup><a id="footnote-reference-3.19" class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-3.19">19</a></sup><a id="p141anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p141">↩</a><span id="p141anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p141">#p141  </span></p>

The lifespan of this house seems very short, but we have no evidence from phases of occupation beyond these dates, and all earlier material belongs to the dumped debris used in site preparation.<a id="p142anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p142">↩</a><span id="p142anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p142">#p142  </span></p>

Two of them opened onto Street 2 to the east and were probably secondary entrances; one of these, in the south corner, seems to have had something to do with the function—unknown—of Room 6, perhaps a reception room for estate dependents. The west entrance was certainly the main one, despite the narrow street it opened on to, with a double-leaf door and a painted side-room (Room 13). The hub of B1, Room 2, was painted in red and yellow ochre on mud plaster; the first decoration of Room 1 was painted on white plaster, now visible only in a few spots below a newer layer of painting; and Rooms 11, 13, and 14 were painted as well.<a id="p143anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p143">↩</a><span id="p143anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p143">#p143  </span></p>

The room was equipped with a suspended wooden floor, perhaps to create a double space for storage vessels—found broken in great quantity on the ground—and to provide a drier area for food storage (<a href="#figure72">Fig. 72</a>). The upper space was reached by means of a newly built stair. In the open-air courtyard (Rooms 9 and 10) just mentioned—not directly connected with the living spaces—mangers were built. Its door, located in the northeast corner, was walled up at a certain point, and the courtyard became a dumping ground. The stable, Building 5, was accessible through a door opening onto the east street. This street (Street 2) underwent some changes too: a large door was built to close its passageway to the north and probably to separate the residential side of the house from the stable. The space in front of Serenos' house was covered with a flat roof—a common feature of the medieval settlements of the Western Desert oases— most probably to protect from the weather and the sand. The flat roof, made of palm beams, did not cover the entrance to the house. Two pillars separated the open-air space from the covered one, where a north-oriented <i>stibadium</i> was built. This dining space had a short life, and the <i>stibadium</i> was soon demolished and its lower part covered with new mud paving.<a id="p146anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p146">↩</a><span id="p146anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p146">#p146  </span></p>

Bins, apparently for storage, were built inside Room 13 (<a href="#figure73">Fig. 73</a>), and a small cooking hearth was made with a few mud bricks in Room 4, immediately in front of the door. The smoke made by the fire would have flowed into the central Room 2 and escaped through two small vertical windows.

Clearly, above Room 2 was an open-air space, probably a roof terrace. There was probably also an open space above the dome in Room 1: it has been supposed that the light entered this room through a central oculus in the dome, but we found no evidence to prove or disprove this hypothesis. The ventilation and the light sources in the house were otherwise limited to small, high openings that were feasible only in some of the ceilings (as in Rooms 1 and 2) and high in the walls of the rooms on the east and west sides. To the north and south the house shared the perimeter walls with two other buildings—respectively, the school/stable (B4/5), and another house built on the same plan but not yet extensively excavated (<span class="reference" rel="dcterms:references" typeof="owl:NamedIndividual"><a rel="rdfs:isDefinedBy" href="http://www.amheida.com/contexts/show/Nzg=" property="rdfs:label" target="_new">B8</a></span>).<a id="p148anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p148">↩</a><span id="p148anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p148">#p148  </span></p>

These houses seem to be the only two in Trimithis with the same plan and dimensions. A complete study of them will, it is hoped, disclose whether the reasons for this coincidence are due to a family connection. However, at some stage barriers were built in the two streets connecting the buildings, to prevent through passage in Street 2 and to regulate it in Street 3. Relations between the families, if relations there were, must have soured, or perhaps one of the houses passed into someone else's hands.<a id="p149anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p149">↩</a><span id="p149anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p149">#p149  </span></p>

Just a few objects were left behind—such as bronze rings, one gold ring, bone hairpins, glass bracelets and beads, and some bronze coins (<a href="#figure75">Fig. 75</a>). Several ostraka provide the name and illuminate the business activities of the owner, but they give us little information about members of the family. Some of these ostraka were found scattered on the floor in Room 2, close to a cupboard in the southwest wall. Two rectangular and quite spacious cupboards built in recesses in the walls were found in this room, each with two shelves. It is possible that originally the ostraka and other objects were stored there.

There were three small niches on the north, east, and south walls; the last one disappeared with the collapse of the wall, but fragments of plaster decoration suggest it was used for a domestic cult. The room itself was probably used for banquets, as is also suggested by the figural scenes; it was accessed by a double-leaf wooden door that opened in the middle of the north wall. Two other painted but smaller rooms (11 and 14) connect with Room 1. These three together form a sort of separate space accessible only through the door between Rooms 1 and 2. Most probably it was used as a reception space, probably for eating, but no furniture, built either in wood or mud brick, nor even traces of their presence on the floors, have been found to confirm this function.<sup><a id="footnote-reference-3.23" class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-3.23">23</a></sup> Only a great quantity of chicken bones was found in Room 14 above the last floor level; these may be indications of a banquet, or at least of eating.<a id="p151anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p151">↩</a><span id="p151anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p151">#p151  </span></p>

No proper kitchen with bread oven, storage, or other cooking equipment has been found in this house or in its courtyard, so it is possible that the cooking area was located on the roof or in a room on the upper floor.<sup><a id="footnote-reference-3.24" class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-3.24">24</a></sup> Room 4 also concealed a treasure comprising bronze objects (<a href="#figure77">Fig. 77</a>). Two lamps, a round box, and a knife with a bone handle were hidden below the floor, near the entrance (<a href="#figure78">Fig. 78</a>). A possible second treasure was a collection of more than thirty bronze coins, found scattered at floor level. A great number of Greek ostraka, fragments of glass vessels, and gypsum stoppers were also found in this room, but some of them came from the collapse of the roof or an upper story.

What we found on the last floor must therefore be connected with the last living phase or with the abandonment of the house. Moreover, we have to consider the possibility that squatters used the rooms before they were totally filled up by sand.<sup><a id="footnote-reference-3.25" class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-3.25">25</a></sup> Coins were found in all rooms but in particular concentrations in Rooms 4, 8, and 14, scattered on the last-phase floors. Ostraka are also common finds in Serenos' house, particularly on the floor of Room 2 and under those of Rooms 4 and 8, in debris dumped before construction.<sup><a id="footnote-reference-3.26" class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-3.26">26</a></sup> There were coins as well as ostraka inside Rooms 4 and 8, the two rooms that look like service spaces, with their rough floors, scattered pockets of ashes, and white bands painted on the walls. The function of room 6 is puzzling, because during the first phase of the house it had an opening onto Street 2: three steps in baked bricks descending into the room were constructed, together with the first mud floor and a shallow bench (width 34 cm, height about 25 cm), also made of baked bricks, directly connected with the steps and running along the south wall of the room (<a href="#figure79">Fig. 79</a>). These features seem to suggest that Room 6—at 7.19 × 3.64 m, the biggest in the house—may have originally had a public or semi-public function linked to the street. The walling-up of the door, probably in connection with the construction of the <i>stibadium</i> just in front of it in Street 2, changed the function of the room, or reflected such a change, but no evidence has been found that can give us any inkling of what the new use was.<a id="p153anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p153">↩</a><span id="p153anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p153">#p153  </span></p>

B2 has ten rooms, of which one is a staircase leading to the second floor or to a terraced roof, and two are small cellars under the stairs. The floors are preserved only in the west half of the house. The entrance to the building is in its northwest corner. It opened directly onto Street 1, the largest thoroughfare of Trimithis. A small entrance room connects directly with a central one, Room 7, that connected with all the other rooms. It functioned as a kitchen: a bread oven and a covered storage bin are built against the north wall (<a href="#figure82">Fig. 82</a>). As in other ancient domestic contexts, the rooms were probably multi-functional:<sup><a id="footnote-reference-3.29" class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-3.29">29</a></sup> a small hearth, hand-molded in mud, is to be seen on the floor of Room 5, and a storage space with two jars was found under the floor in Room 6 (<a href="#figure83">Fig. 83</a>). Loom weights found inside the house and in the courtyard suggest that a domestic vertical loom was in use here. Besides the common-ware pottery vessels, other objects have been discovered such as fragments of glass vessels, and items of personal adornment—silver- and gold-glass beads, glass and faience beads, an Egyptian amulet (Bes), glass bracelets, bronze rings, and bone hairpins. A few of the items are fragments of wooden tools and furniture. A few Greek ostraka and one clay tablet with a Greek text listing disbursements of doum-fruits were found in the house, but it is impossible to determine with any confidence which, if any, of these objects had to do with the resident family and its social and economic activities (<a href="#figure84">Fig. 84</a>). We can certainly say that the ostraka found in this house deal with the transportation and handling of agricultural commodities on a larger scale than would have been typical of an ordinary household.<a id="p157anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p157">↩</a><span id="p157anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p157">#p157  </span></p>

These two are the ones with the fireplaces, and for this reason they have been interpreted by the excavator as inner courtyards, or open or partly open rooms. However, for architectural and climatic reasons this hypothesis is difficult to substantiate. It is possible that one or both of these spaces had lightweight flat roofs. The absence of collapsed walls and ceilings prevents us from assessing fully the presence or absence of niches, the position and the kind of windows, and the presence of any sort of decoration.<a id="p158anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p158">↩</a><span id="p158anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p158">#p158  </span></p>

Even if, were we to make our way to B2 along the covered alleys of Trimithis from the house of Serenos, we perceived no change in the external environment, once we stepped inside the door of B2 we would be struck by the difference. For instance, although the owner kept his household records in Greek, like Serenos, the walls were apparently unadorned except for whitewash and stripes of color; neither classical mythology in artistic representation nor quotations from classical literature greeted the visitor.<a id="p159anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p159">↩</a><span id="p159anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p159">#p159  </span></p>

On the archaeobotanical front, this house has yielded emmer wheat, another traditionally Egyptian foodstuff that was alien to the Greek and Roman diet and almost entirely missing from the papyrological documentation after the early Roman period; and the tablet mentioned above records distributions of doum-fruits, an Egyptian specialty. Probably the inhabitants drank wine, however—beer had lost its dominant place in Egyptian drinking by this time. Although this house was far from unmarked by six hundred years of Greek and Roman rule, it furnishes a strong reminder of just how varied and individual was the integration of the population of a remote city like Trimithis into the culture of the Roman Empire.<a id="p160anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p160">↩</a><span id="p160anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p160">#p160  </span></p>

They seem to have been quite closed, in order to shut out the wind, the sand, and the sun. They were built with the same technique and the same materials, had shallow foundations and no underground cellars. Domestic life certainly took place also on a second story or a terraced roof, accessed by a staircase built around a central pillar. In both cases the staircase is located not in a corner of the house, but in the central room. Worth notice is the fact that in both dwellings people would have entered from the street via a few steps descending into a vestibule (or Room 6 in B1), and the doorways were all closed by wooden doors, including the one that opened on to the stairs. There are no bath or toilet facilities. This kind of house—whose main distinguishing feature is a central room giving access to the other rooms—is also common at Kellis.<a id="p161anchor" class="id_link" style="color:aaa;display:none" href="#p161">↩</a><span id="p161anchor_label" style="color:aaa;display:none;position:fixed;right:0;bottom:50%" href="#p161">#p161  </span></p>
